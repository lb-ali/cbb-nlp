# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Sean Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13714)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: I would like to introduce Sean Sutton from Oklahoma State. Coach
is graciously planned on doing an opening statement here._  
SEAN SUTTON: Let me just say this. Last season was a very difficult season for
our basketball team and a tough experience of our players. I was very proud of
that team, the way they hung together and fought through some adversity, some
things that were going on off the court that were out of their control and,
yet, still maintained focus and came to practice every day to get better and
played our best basketball down the season, which I think has helped build
momentum in this season.  
We have been in practice one week. I'll say this, I like the attitude of this
basketball team. One of the things that hurt us a year ago was that team was
very talented, but that team, we could never quite get them together and there
was chemistry issues throughout the season.  
And the one thing that I think we have really prided ourselves at Oklahoma
State through the years is playing hard and guys that play hard and play as a
team. When those things have happened, we have won a lot of games. Last year's
team we just did not reflect a normal Oklahoma State basketball team.  
But back to this season. So far in our workouts, we have got eight guys out
there right now. All eight of the guys have practiced hard. They have
committed to this basketball program. But more importantly, they have
committed to each other, and it has shown in their enthusiasm on the practice
court. It has shown in their ability to help their teammates and I like it. I
think they learned from some tough, tough losses that happened a year ago, and
they have grown up quite a bit.  
All of them have worked really hard over the summer to improve their
individual games. They got stronger in the weight room. They have gotten --
worked on some of the weaknesses they had in their games, and as a result they
are better players.  
Just one week in, I like what I see, because I go back to the point that they
are together and they are a team and that's what you want and it is our job to
help keep them that way.  
The way they are going right now, I am very pleased.  
  
Q. Sean, this may be an unfair question, but I know you have been with your
dad so long and experienced so much great success, is there anything that we
could expect to see you different from the Oklahoma State system for so many
years?  
SEAN SUTTON: Coach, that's a great question. I would say 90% of my system will
reflect his system. When you look at what he has been able to do and the games
he was able to win at all the different places he coached, he has changed some
things through the years. He played faster his last ten years at Oklahoma
State than he probably ever played ever. He made the adjustment to the three-
point shot, but the basics, the basis of his system was always playing tough,
hard-nosed, aggressive man-to-man defense, taking care of the basketball,
taking high-percentage shots, getting your team where they understand what you
are trying to do, and you don't beat yourself, and then you play as a team.
You play hard and you play as a team. That's always been kind of his
foundation for his teams in the past.  
I look at that and I think it is very similar to what we are going to try to
do. We are going to try to play aggressive, tough defense. We have got to
limit our turnovers. Last year we averaged almost 18 turnovers a game, which
was 296th in the country and that's ridiculous. We would like that number to
be down more like 12.  
We have always prided ourselves on shooting a high percentage from the field.
Three years ago we led the nation in field goal shooting. The year after that,
I think we were third and first in three-point shooting, and then last year,
even in an off-year, I think we still shot 48, something from the field.  
Taking good shots is always going to be important. The one thing I would say
is that I probably let some of our players that could shoot, they will be
given a little more freedom to shoot the basketball than maybe he did at
times. It doesn't mean they will be casting out 25-footers, I can promise you.  
I want them to have the confidence to jump up if they are open or they have an
opportunity to drive the ball and make a play. I always think rebounding is a
huge concern.  
And the three areas -- I will go back to my point. Three areas with this team
that have got to get better, we have got to take care of the basketball, we
have got to rebound at both ends, and our defense have got to reflect a team,
an Oklahoma State-type team in terms of defensively.  
Last year, we were not nearly as good defensively as we have been in the past.
So those three areas right there will determine, in my opinion, what kind of
season we have. Will we take care of the ball; will we rebound; will we play
tough, aggressive defense.  
Two things I might change a little bit for maybe what my dad, his philosophy
is, we may play a little faster. I wouldn't say a whole lot faster because we
played pretty fast these last ten years. We averaged almost 80 points two or
three of those years.  
But we may press a little bit more and extend our pressure 94 feet. And then
the other area is we may mix in a zone to keep teams off balance. Or if we get
in foul trouble, a couple key guys in foul trouble, jump into a zone.  
And that's something that he just didn't like to play. He used to always say
every time we thought about putting -- going to zone, he would be like, Mr.
Iba, he's going to roll over in his grave. Are you sure you guys want to do
that to him?  
We are committed to that, and we practiced this week. They were good in it. So
we will see. Hopefully it will help us.  
  
Q. Sean, everybody knows JamesOn had kind of a difficult personnel year last
year. He seems so much more relaxed. What kind of season do you expect out of
him?  
SEAN SUTTON: I think he will go back and play like the player he was his
freshman year. I think his confidence level is high right now. He knows I have
a tremendous amount of confidence in him. I believe in him. He can really
shoot the basketball, but he can do more than that.  
He is a guy, he is a very good passer. He got into problems last year because
he was playing with a whole new group of guys and it took him a period of time
to adjust to them. And then I thought he started pressing. He started losing
confidence, and as a result, just did not have the type of season that I know
we needed him to have and the type of season that he wanted to have. But
that's behind him, and this is a new season.  
I do, I think you will see the old JamesOn. I think you will see him play with
a lot of enthusiasm out there. He is shooting the basketball extremely well
right now. He looks quicker, and he is making better decisions with the ball.  
One area that he has got to get better in is he has got to become a better
defender. Pick a weakness for him and Boggan. Both of those guys have got to
defend at a higher level. And Boggan has to rebound at a higher level.  
There's no question. Those two guys and I would say Byron Eaton right now are
probably the three best players at this point in time on the team.  
  
Q. Sean, obviously the theme of the Big 12 in the off-season was the amount
of change in the coaching ranks, six out of 12. Obviously, you go through
that, too, but at a much lesser level at OSU.  
SEAN SUTTON: It is a little bit different for me, I think, because I have been
part of the program for so long and the players that I am coaching this year,
I coached last year, and that's a little bit different for the other guys.  
But I am excited about all of the new coaches coming into the Big 12, and I
think everybody else should be. I think we've added some outstanding coaches
and it would be good for the league. Bob Huggins, I think his name right there
speaks for itself. He has got Kansas State. Their fans can't wait for
basketball season.  
We have played against Mike Anderson's teams when he was at be UAB, and I will
say this, I was really, really impressed with how hard those teams played, how
hard both those teams played that we played against them, and the way they
executed their system.  
They will be difficult for people to figure out playing them the first time.
And then some of the other new coaches coming in will do a terrific job as
well. So I think it is exciting for the Big 12.  
And somebody asked me back over there, Do you think the Big 12 needs to win a
national championship? Well, I think we are on the verge of getting there. We
are on the verge of winning one. We had a great stretch there right after
2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, where we had five of the 12 teams in the Final 4.
Kansas went twice. Texas went once. We went once. And Oklahoma went once, I
believe.  
I think it is just a matter of time before we win one. Kansas this year, in my
opinion, their talent level is as good as anybody in the country. There is no
question. When you look at Chalmers and you look at Wright and you look at
Russell Robinson and Rush and Kaun and Jackson and Giles and Sherron Collins.
I asked Bill out there, Would you be willing to trade -- make a couple trades?  
He said, No chance.  
Those guys are very talented and certainly talented enough to win the national
championship because they got good players, but they also got a great coaching
staff. I put them with North Carolina and Florida as the three most-talented
teams.  
So don't be surprised if it happens this year. It could happen this year. If
it doesn't, it will happen soon. Eventually we are going to win a national
championship in basketball in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Sean, is it a much different feeling for you now that it's your program?
And can you also maybe talk about how much you are going to consult your dad
during the season?  
SEAN SUTTON: I mean, I think it is a little bit different. You step up and all
of a sudden you are the head coach. There is more responsibilities for sure. I
think I had the luxury of handling a lot of responsibilities through the years
that a lot of assistants don't have the opportunity to do. So in that way
maybe I am more prepared than most. But it is still different and it is still,
I think, the time is the biggest issue.  
I am looking forward to it. And Oklahoma State is obviously a very special,
special place to me, having played there on two Sweet 16 teams, having coached
there as an assistant on two Final 4 teams. The ultimate for me is to bring a
national championship back to Gallagher-Iba arena. We have two. I would like
to see another one hung up there.  
In terms of my dad, that's going to be up to him. I would love for him to come
by practice any time he feels like he has time to. Right now, he is staying
pretty busy. He has got two jobs. He moves around quite a bit. He is looking
good. I think he feels better than he has felt in five to seven years.  
When things slow down for him, sure, I would love for him to come to practice.
Much like when Mr. Iba used to come back and watch practice when he first
started coaching. I know that Bill Self, assistant there, Rob Evans was an
assistant there with my dad. How much they enjoyed Mr. Iba coming to practice
every day and giving his input. And when he has that opportunity, sure, we
would love to have him back and give us his opinion and his input on things.  
That's his decision. I want him to come when wants to come.  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay, coach. We appreciate your comments. We wish you the best
for the season. Thank you all very much._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Joining us at the podium is Coach Bill Self from Kansas.
Welcome, Coach. We will let you make an opening comment or two and we will
take questions._  
COACH SELF: It is good to get back to Oklahoma City even though it is just for
a few hours here. Always feels good to come home.  
And hopefully we have got a team this year that I would say would be more
consistent and more experienced and hopefully more proven than the team we had
last year, even though last year's team finished strong.  
I really like our guys. They are working pretty hard - I don't want to say
really hard because I think they can always work harder, but certainly they
are working pretty hard, and they seem to like each other and are really
together right now. And it is a long season, but certainly we like our team
and feel like we have a chance to be pretty good if we can catch a few breaks
here or there.  
  
Q. Bill, talk about what your inside game looks like with your bigs right
now and how much Darrell Arthur may figure in that big picture?  
COACH SELF: Darrell will be one of the better new guys in our league, no
question, and he is a talent. He doesn't understand what we are trying to get
accomplished consistently, but certainly he picks up things fast and hopefully
will be a guy by the time the league rolls around that will be comfortable.  
We have good depth inside. We can throw size at you. We can throw some length
at you. And with, barring injuries or whatever, I do think that we have at
least four guys that can certainly be an impact player and give us pivotal
minutes. And a lot of teams are pretty fortunate because a lot of teams don't
have four guys they can rely on, I think, like we can.  
  
Q. Bill, you'd probably rather have the Big 12 tournament in Kansas City
every year, but being a native here, what's this going to mean for the area
and maybe the league?  
COACH SELF: Well, I've -- I think Oklahoma City will do a fabulous job
supporting this tournament. I don't think there is any doubt about that. The
people I have spoken to down here are very excited about having it.  
With the two colleges so close, OU and OSU, there is a natural fan base
already. And it will be "the" show. I know we have the Hornets here in town,
but it will certainly be "the" show for that week, I believe. I think it will
be great.  
I am selfish. I always love having the tournament -- the Big 8 tournament in
Kansas City when I was at Oklahoma State as an assistant. When the new arena
is built there, I do think it will once again support the tournament in a
first-class fashion like it always has. I certainly anticipate Oklahoma City
will do the same this particular year.  
  
Q. Another young guy everybody is talking about, Sherron Collins. Do you
give him the ball from the get-go?  
COACH SELF: Probably not. Sherron is a very talented guy and he has picked up
things remarkably quick, but we return three pretty good perimeter players,
and I think all four of those guys, if you add Sherron to that mix, will
certainly get ample minutes.  
But to say to give him the ball right off the bat, I think would be an
overstatement. I think he will be a natural leader. I think he will be a point
guard that can shoot the ball a little bit. But it is going to take him time
just like it takes most freshman time to get totally acclimated and
comfortable.  
  
Q. Bill, any sense at all of what all the new coaches are going to do to
this league and how much things are going to change?  
COACH SELF: The new coaches?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH SELF: I think things will change for the better. I really do. I think
the respective institutions made great hires. You look at the background of
all the guys that have been hired, they have all made an impact on the game,
not only regionally but nationally. I am excited about our league.  
I think that this is not saying bad things about previous programs because all
programs go through phases at some point in time where they need a little bit
of an energy boost. I think that certainly happened with the respective hires.
I think the game will be faster. More up tempo and more pressure on both ends
and a fan-friendly game and certainly one with the different styles.  
I do think it is a preparation -- preparation league for post-season
tournament. I really believe our league, a lot of teams play the same way
since I have been in the league. I think you will have the pressing, the half-
court offensive sets, the all-out denial. You will have a lot of different
systems in place now that I think would be great preparation for all the
respective teams.  
  
Q. Bill, talk about how Julian Wright and Brandon Rush have grown from this
time last year when they were a freshman?  
COACH SELF: Last year when Brandon was a freshman, he didn't make many baskets
in practice. He was so nonaggressive that it was hard to get him to look for a
shot or look to score. When performed in the game, it was almost like a
pleasant surprise to us. Because for the majority of the season, he averaged
about 15 a game and shot 50 from three and from two. He was a very pleasant
surprise last year.  
I think the one thing about him this year, he will be more aggressive. Your
leading scorer, not very often should shoot 50% from three. He has got to take
more shots than that. He has to take the perfect shot most of the time. He has
to be a guy that looks to score. I want him to shoot 50%, but if he shot 42 or
43, that means he is probably be a lot more aggressive, at least from three.  
I hope that he is more aggressive and Julian has improved strength-wise. Last
year at this stage, Julian was trying to find his way. He did not play a lot
early in the season. By Christmas, him and Mario had come into their own a
little bit.  
All those guys have improved. I think the biggest thing they have done, they
are a year older and a year wiser.  
  
Q. Most people thought Brandon wasn't very aggressive. This time last year
people thought he would be one year done and come out and look for a shot and
put up numbers. Were you surprised about that?  
COACH SELF: Just about everything Brandon has done from a team standpoint has
been a pleasant surprise to me. He is an unselfish for a fault. He thinks "we"
instead of "me". He is as liked by his teammates as anybody we have. He will
work every bit as hard as anybody does as long as you are there to push him to
do so.  
And he is a guy that enjoys school. Those are all qualities that people
probably didn't feel about with him when first came to Kansas.  
I would say I would be surprised, I would be surprised at this time last year
that he is back a second year after seeing how much he enjoyed school and
college and the season last year, I am not surprised at all that he chose to
come back.  
  
Q. You were picked to win the league. Do you feel that confident about it? I
can probably guess that answer. And who else among the league, how would you
survey the rest of the league?  
COACH SELF: I didn't pick us, so it is not unanimous. I picked Gillispie. I
think that we have -- based on how we finished in the number of players that
returned, I think you would say that this would be a team that has a chance to
be pretty good this year. But every year is different and last year we were
forced in so many ways to escape injuries and things like that.  
But I do think we will have a nice team, not predicting anything, just a nice
team that has a chance to be very good over time.  
But I love Billy's team. I think they are tough and I think they have got some
young players that can really shoot and stretch the defense around Joseph.  
And I think Texas is very talented. Texas is going to be very similar to how
we were last year. I think Oklahoma State, to me, they were just an eyelash
away from really having a very, very, very good one-loss record last year.
Lost a lot of close games, but they were right there and they were very young.  
Kansas State has a majority of guys back, plus they have new energy. They will
be very good. Baylor is much improved. Texas Tech will be a lot better just
because of the recruits and having a healthy Jackson and Zeno. Zeno played
hurt last year. There are good players in our league. Our league RPI, or
overall strength of our league nationally, at least from an appearance
standpoint, I think will be much stronger this year.  
  
Q. Sasha Kaun, what is his role going to be on this team? Is there more to
his game than we have seen so far?  
COACH SELF: I hope so. Sasha didn't start playing ball until he was a
sophomore in high school, and that was the first time he had seen ball. They
didn't have a lot of leagues in Siberia where he lived that he could play. He
just started playing ball when he went to Florida Air Academy as a sophomore
and played because he was tall.  
He's made remarkable progress in a short amount of time. But he hasn't shown
us the consistent ability to score or have great feel around the basket and
touch. But those are things that he worked hard on. He is a very good post-
defender. He is the anchor of our team on both ends of the courts when he is
in the game. He is a very, very, very good athlete that sometimes goes
unnoticed because he can really run and jump and he is strong. I think he will
have a big year.  
I think he is right where he should be based on how much experience he's had.
These next two years hopefully will be ones in which he shows great
improvement.  
  
Q. Bill, can you talk about Bob Huggins and some of the guys -- some of the
recruits he is getting into Manhattan, Kansas, over there?  
COACH SELF: I think Bob will do a great job in Manhattan, fabulous. I know
that at the very end of the recruiting period last year when schools are
scrambling, trying to find some help late, he was able to go out and get two
or three guys that are going to be difference-makers on his team immediately.
So that's a great feather right there.  
I don't follow K State recruiting. I have enough to worry about with my own,
but I do hear that they are obviously involved with some very good players. If
they are able to get those very good players, then certainly that will enhance
any program.  
We will know a lot more about recruiting come November when the ink is dry, so
to speak. But I think they are off to a really good start based on everything
I have heard.  
  
Q. Bill, you talk about those four inside players, that is not including
C.J.?  
COACH SELF: I think I said at least four, so I know we have Darnell, Julian,
Sasha and Darrell. That will be where I am right now in that situation, as of
today.  
  
Q. Bill, obviously you got ties to Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. What are
your thoughts on Sean Sutton taking over the program?  
COACH SELF: I coached Sean and he was a very smart beyond-his-years player
with unbelievable feel. In large part, he grew up in a home that understood
ball pretty well and been in a lot of locker rooms. So I think from that
vantage point, he was beyond his years. And certainly as an assistant coach,
he is tough. He is competitive. He understands the game. He has got a very
good offense mind, and I think he will do very, very well.  
I think Coach Sutton will be missed by everybody who loves Oklahoma State and
he has been very good for this league, but the transition will be one that's
very smooth, I feel. I think they will do extremely well. And I look to them
to be one of our real challengers in our league and should have a great
season.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck for the season._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: It is now time for Nebraska. And at this time we would like to
welcome Doc Sadler from Nebraska. From Nebraska, we have got the coach and so,
Coach, welcome. If you would like to make an opening comment or two, and then
we will take questions._  
COACH SADLER: Thanks, Peter. First of all, before we ever get started, I want
everybody knows there is a football game in Lincoln this Saturday. I think it
is at 11:00. If you haven't made arrangements to get there, tickets are pretty
difficult, but give us a call.  
First of all, let me say what a pleasure and an honor it is to be sitting here
as the Coach of University of Nebraska. It seems like a couple of months ago I
got the opportunity to go there and it has gone pretty fast since then.  
The thing you know as basketball coaches, you look forward to, is the
opportunity to start practice, which we were able to do last Friday. And
things were going quite well, in my opinion. Our guys were working as hard as
you could ask them to work. We just don't have the numbers right now. We are
down to basically seven scholarship players that are practicing and don't know
when we are going to get the remaining guys back, hopefully soon as far as
that goes, you just deal with it.  
And our players have put all that behind them, and every time that I have
asked them to come to the practice floor, in my opinion, they have given me
everything that they have got. That's been a pleasant surprise, and it is also
a compliment to them.  
This basketball team I think has got some strengths to it. Probably the
biggest strength is I think they like each other. It is a team that seems to
get along. It is not a team that seems to be jealous of anybody, and I think
you can do some good things when you have that kind of character on it.  
I hope it can shoot the basketball, and right now in the shooting drills, it
has shown that it can. Now whether we can when people are guarding us, I don't
know.  
If anything, those two things, the character issue and then being able to
shoot the basketball, if we can do those two things, I think it will be a team
that will have a lot of fun.  
I don't know how many games they will win. I do know as I have told them, I am
not really concerned about that. We will just concern ourselves with going out
and trying to play hard every single day, and wins and losses, therefore, will
take care of itself. Again, we just got to get through this one period here,
and once we do that, I think things will be okay.  
Schedule, we just got it finished. I think if you look at our schedule, it is
not so much -- I mean, the teams we are playing I think are difficult, but it
is when we play them. We go to Rutgers on the road and on the same trip you go
to Oregon. Get some frequent flyer miles. That's to warm us up to go to Hawaii
and then come back and go to Miami. So I think it is the scheduling that it's
when it's at is going to be some difficult times. But at the same time, I
think it is going to make our team tougher. And I think that's something that
we need, is we need to make sure that our guys understand that it is going to
be difficult.  
I was talking to my best friend Coach Gillispie a couple of nights ago and we
were just talking about how things were going. And being the friend that he
is, he reminded me that, Doc, understand something, every game in the Big 12
is going to be difficult, like I didn't know that already. But he reminded me,
so I haven't slept since then.  
I think our team will be ready for that and I look forward to being a small
part in that.  
  
Q. Doc, what is your sense of the basketball culture at Nebraska and what
kind of potential for support do you see there?  
COACH SADLER: I think Nebraska is a little bit unusual, and what I mean by
that is obviously it is a so-called football school. But what you have got in
Nebraska is you've got every sport being very important to everyone in the
state. I think if you look back, Mike, over the years, I don't care what sport
it is, as long as you are wearing a Nebraska uniform, they are going to
support it. I thought that would be the case, and it is the case.  
I think because -- obviously what they have done there in football is given us
a chance to have the very best of everything there. So that's the thing we can
go out and sell. I think it is important.  
I think the people there -- the two months that I have been there, they say
they are more excited than they have been in a long, long time. They want good
basketball at Nebraska, and I think with the recent success of Florida, of
Texas, of Oklahoma, so-called football places, with the success that those
schools have enjoyed, I think they realize now we can have both. And that's
what we are going to shoot for.  
  
Q. Doc, you took the job a little bit later than normally would happen as
far as a basketball coaching changes go, and you are playing with basically
somebody else's recruits. I wonder if you can talk about the challenge of that
and trying to get your program running at a very speedy break.  
COACH SADLER: I think, first of all, it was late, obviously, and we didn't
have, as Coach Self was mentioning, the opportunity in the spring to go get
some other players.  
The thing I told Charles Richardson and Marcus Perry and the other guys, that
can be an excuse or that can be a reality, and we are just going to look at it
as a reality.  
The thing I want to do, and there are some former coaches in here, it's
Charles Richardson's and Marcus Perry's last year. We need to do everything we
can now, even though you can say they are not -- they are my players. The day
I took the job, they became my players, and I owe Charles and Marcus every
ounce of energy to try to do something now.  
I will be there for a few years. They are not going to be. They don't want to
hear about what's going to happen two years or three years down the road. They
want to know, Coach, what are we going to do now?  
And I believe that, and that's what I owe them. We are taking it on every day
like that's the most important thing.  
  
Q. Doc, I was just curious, Barry Collier always had one of the slower-paced
teams in the Big 12. I know you well enough to know you have always tried to
play fast. Do you have the talent to do that?  
COACH SADLER: Well, I think we have got to do that. Again, I am trying to do
what's best for this basketball team today. I don't know that the -- I don't
know that the speed and things are as big a concern right now, Coach, as it is
the numbers. The numbers really concern me. We are down to seven players.
That's how many guys that are practicing with us.  
That may dictate a little bit, but if we get some of those guys back, we are
going to play baseline to baseline. I think that's what players want to play,
that's what people want to see, and that's the way I like to coach.  
  
Q. Doc, have any of the players just stopped and talked to you about the
tempo and playing faster? Have they thanked you for it in any way or just said
that's what they wanted to do?  
COACH SADLER: I think -- I think, like most cases, I think they were excited
until last Friday evening. I think they understand now the effort, the hard
work that it takes to play that style.  
Obviously, right now it is not a fun time for them. But they have adjusted and
they like it, they like it. Our practices are a little bit different as far
as, what Coach Howard's was talking about, I think the pace was much slower in
practice. You can come to watch us practice, we will practice 94 feet. We will
not be a half court, 15, 20 minutes and then move on. We are going to practice
full court also.  
  
Q. The change of scenery, Doc, the contrast between El Paso and Lincoln,
Nebraska, have you had that shock yet?  
COACH SADLER: It is much warmer in Lincoln contrary to what some of you all
think. It is pretty warm up there. It is funny because when we were flying in
the first day, Mike, we would get about 1,000 feet above and my two boys was
with me and my wife and they said "Oh, my goodness, there's trees and there is
grass".  
But El Paso was a tremendous and a great place to live. I know some of you may
have never been out there. We loved it out there. It was a great place for my
family. But it is good to be back where there's four seasons and the trees are
turning color and you got to wear a jacket every now and then. That part of it
has been great.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, best of luck to you for the season. Thank you very much._  
COACH SADLER: Thanks, Peter. Thank you all.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Ricardo Patton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13705)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: It is now time to bring Coach Ricardo Patton up from Colorado
University. Coach, welcome. If you would like to make an opening comment or
two._  
COACH PATTON: Thank you. Well, I guess I would like -- I should thank the
coaches for making my job a lot easier this season. If we are going to finish
12th, I can play a little bit more golf and learn how to fish or something.  
Seriously, I think our guys are working extremely hard and so far I don't
believe I have seen a 12th-place team in our practices. We will wait and see
what happens.  
  
Q. Ricardo, I assume all your guys now know each other, but have you seen
enough of them to be able to tell how many of those guys are going to be part
of your regular rotation?  
COACH PATTON: I would say out of the eight guys, eight freshman, probably five
of those guys will play major minutes. And we have some guys, even though they
are young, they have a degree of maturity that I really like.  
Xavier Silas is a guy that really stands out. His father, James Silas, played
in NBA, and San Antonio Spurs just retired his Jersey last season. It is
obviously to me that his father, James Silas, has prepared his son for the
next level. In my mind he is probably better than Richard Roby was at the same
stage.  
Jeremy Williams is the young player, 6' 8", out of Memphis, Tennessee. His
high school team went 39-0 last year. They were the sixth best team in the
country, high school-wise, and he is a guy that will make a difference.  
We have a young man by the name of Jermyl Jackson-Wilson who sat out last
season for us after transferring from Ohio State that I think people are
unfamiliar with that has been a great surprise for me and is doing a nice job.  
But in saying all that, the guys still have to go through and they have to
gain some experience. Hopefully in our nonconference schedule, which I think
is a good schedule, it will prepare those guys for the grind and the physical
play and the speed of basketball at this level.  
  
Q. You addressed a little bit what I was going to ask. I was going to ask
how quickly you thought the freshman could adjust and make an impact and how
far along they are. And beyond that, when you made your opening comment, were
you a little bit taken aback and feeling a little irate at being picked 12th?
Did it bother you?  
COACH PATTON: About the 12th place pick? No. I can understand that really. I
think any time a team is as young as we are in those positions, I can see
where you would think that they may not fare as well.  
But we also have some guys that I think understand what it takes to play in
the Big 12. Richard Roby certainly understands what it takes to compete at
this level. Dominique Coleman has done a terrific job for us and is a guy that
came to us last year from a junior college. We have moved him off the ball a
little bit and enabled him to go back to what he did in junior college that
made him successful and that's to be more of a scorer for us.  
Jermyl Wilson that I mentioned earlier was at Ohio State as a freshman,
understands what big-time basketball is all about.  
And then Marcus King-Stockton has done a nice job for us.  
At our point guard position, we will probably start a freshman between Dwight
Thorne and Kal Bay. Both of those guys have shown the ability to bring
something just a little bit different to the floor and both of those guys will
play major minutes for us.  
That's difficult at times to ask the freshman to come in and play at this
level right away, particularly when you have to face a guy like Jarrius
Jackson, who I believe is arguably the best point guard in our league. But I
think we will be better than most people think at this point.  
  
Q. Ricardo, one thing everybody has been talking about and asking about this
morning is the changes in the league, six new coaches. I believe you are the
last original Big 12 coach, the last guy who was here for the inaugural
season.  
COACH PATTON: Is that like last of the Mohicans?  
  
Q. Major survivor, I guess. Has it been kind of what you would think it
would be, or just looking around, are there any changes that you have noticed
that maybe surprise you?  
COACH PATTON: Well, I just think it was very unusual for a league such as ours
to have as many changes as it did last season. But I think it also speaks well
that there are other coaches in other conferences that would love to coach in
the Big 12.  
This is a fantastic league. All the guys that came into the league had success
at their previous places, and so it is just -- I think it is an exciting time
for our conference.  
I think that the media attention that that will bring to our league this year
will just add to the Big 12.  
  
Q. Along those lines, do you think that those new coaches will change the
style of play or do you think that they will have to adapt to maybe the Big 12
style that more established coaches have kind of instilled already?  
COACH PATTON: I think guys like Bobby Huggins won't change the way he believes
he ought to do things. His teams have always been known for playing extremely
physical. They certainly like to extend their defense. He is getting some
great commitments from players across the country.  
And so you -- I think what you will see more than anything is just maybe the
talent level pick up at Kansas State.  
I think when you think about Mike Anderson at Missouri, you will see teams
that resemble the Arkansas -- the old Arkansas style of play. And so it will
be different in that way. I think those guys will do that until they can't do
it any longer.  
And so maybe we will have to make some adjustments, but quite frankly I think
the biggest adjustment will be when we play a Missouri team because that will
be a little bit different than any other style of play. Playing physical, Big
12 has always been physical. And so that won't be a big change.  
  
Q. Ricardo, did you have a talk with the team about your contract situation?
Did you bring it up? Does it trickle down to the players and how are you
handling it?  
COACH PATTON: No, I don't think it should trickle down to the players. The
first part of your question, yes, we have talked about that. And what we have
said is that we are not going to talk about that. I don't think that my
contract should be the players' responsibility. And as I mentioned to you
earlier today, I have said to Mike Bohn, our athletic director, I am at peace
with who I am, I am at peace with the job we have done and I am at peace with
leaving the University of Colorado, if that be the case.  
So with that being said, I don't think that I want to coach under any type of
pressure to try to save my job. I don't want to put that type of pressure on
my players. I certainly don't want to live with that type of pressure. And I
think when you can be at peace with the three things that I mentioned, then I
think it allows you to go out and coach and have fun and enjoy your kids, and
that's what I plan to do.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you have only had a few practices so far. How are you
having to approach this year in practices with all the new guys, whereas, last
year every one of those players knew what to expect coming in?  
COACH PATTON: One of the things we tried to make sure of, I have made it
mandatory that my staff get out of the office. We practice through the week at
3:30 in the afternoon. We made it mandatory that before that practice, the
entire staff, they have to leave the office and get out and get lunch or do
whatever. But I want them to come to practice every day energized and ready to
teach, because that's what having a young group of guys requires is a great
deal of teaching.  
And we want to make sure that we are not distracted in any way with anything
other than the job at hand, and that's just being good coaches and leaders to
our young men.  
  
Q. Ricardo, you mentioned that Xavier has learned some things from his dad.
Can you come up with some specifics that he might have picked up just being
around the game?  
COACH PATTON: One of the things that's very noticeable from a coaching
standpoint is when you get young guys, you try to teach them to play
basketball in an explosive position and catching the ball low, particularly
when they are coming off of screens. Coming off screens, more shot ready. He
has that already and that's very difficult to teach.  
Most guys play basketball too erect. If you notice guys at the next level,
they all play with a low center of gravity and he really does that extremely
well. Has a great mid-range game. I think too many times guys only believe
that there is a three-point shot or there is a layup. Well, there is some
basketball floor in between both of those. I think he understands that. He has
a great mid-range game.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, we thank you very much. Wish you the best of luck._  
COACH PATTON: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: It is now time for Iowa State. Welcome, Coach Greg McDermott.
Welcome to the league, Coach._  
COACH McDERMOTT: Thank you.  
_PETER IRWIN: If would you like to make an opening comment or two, and then we
will take questions, if that's okay._  
COACH McDERMOTT: I am just excited to be in the Big 12. I am the dean of the
new coaches in the Big 12. I was first, so I was joking with someone outside
that I am as close to being the dean of coaches in any league I have ever
coached in and I have only been here seven months.  
It is an honor and privilege to take over the Iowa State program. Having grown
up in the state of Iowa, I am very familiar with the tradition of Iowa State
basketball that Coach Orr started back in the mid '80s. And the fan base there
is as passionate as anywhere in the country, and I have been able to witness
that as a child and it has continued today. It has really been a lot of fun to
be part of that.  
  
Q. Hey, coach, with a week of practice under your belt, what's the biggest
thing you are trying to get this team to understand early? And considering the
inexperience of it all, I mean, are you concerned at all that you don't want
them to get discouraged if things go rough early on?  
COACH McDERMOTT: It is always -- this is my fourth time taking over a new
program and it is like coaching a group of freshman from the first day of
practice because you don't have the seniors to help the freshman with the next
drill and to make sure that they are doing it correctly. They are all learning
together at the same time, and that can be frustrating for the players. It can
force coaches to be impatient at times.  
We are trying to instill some discipline, particularly on the defensive end of
the floor. With only four returning scholarship players and a host of walk-ons
and six new players to our program that aren't familiar with the style of
defensive basketball that we are going to play, it takes some time to instill
that in them.  
They played a different way defensively a year ago. Not that there was
anything wrong with that, it is just a different philosophy than what I'm
accustomed to and there are a lot of changes that have been necessary from a
player's standpoint. To their credit, they are working hard and they have
approached our practices with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of energy.  
  
Q. We know you don't have a lot of players returning but I have heard a lot
about the junior college point guard you have brought in from California. Is
he has good as advertised?  
COACH McDERMOTT: Well, we brought in two junior college guards, Corey McIntosh
from California and Mike Taylor from Chipola in Florida. Both of those young
men give us an opportunity to have a competitive guard court. What I like
about both of them, they came from very successful junior college programs.
Corey McIntosh's team, I think Corey only lost four games in his two years at
junior college. And Mike Taylor, I believe, lost eight games. There is that
winning attitude that they have brought along with them from junior college
and kind of a -- they have been very tough-minded in everything they have
done.  
And it has been refreshing to have new guys do that because obviously you need
the returners to act in that way any time you are trying to break in some
freshman that will have to play valuable minutes. I have been pleased with
their progress so far.  
  
Q. It is never easy going into a new league. Being one of six new guys, half
the league has turned over coaches, is there some value to coming in at that
time?  
COACH McDERMOTT: It would be difficult to come into a league that you are the
only new guy and everybody else is established. I think because of the fact
that there is five other coaches that feel the same pain that I feel right now
after a week of practice with a new team -- it is hard for coaches by nature
to be patient, and you have to be when you take over a new program because you
just can't put too much on your players' plate at too fast of a rate.  
Because there is so much turnover, I am just one of the gang. It is going to
take some time to build these programs. It does not happen overnight, at least
not the way that I do it. But I think it gives you a chance to be successful
because there is some inexperience and some other programs that are dealing
with some of the things we are dealing with as well, and players don't have a
great understanding of what the coaches' expectations are at this point in
time.  
  
Q. Obviously you're familiar with this conference just from a spectator's
standpoint growing up in the area of the old Big 8 and everything like that.
But what kind of idea do you bring for your program coming in and playing in
the Big 12? What do you think you will see?  
COACH McDERMOTT: From our standpoint, I hope we can bring some discipline to
the way we play. And I think sometimes people mistake the word "discipline"
with "methodical". I think you can be disciplined and play fast. You can be
disciplined and play slow. You can play zone or man-to-man and still be
disciplined. A common thread among successful teams, they play with some sort
of discipline in what they are trying to accomplish.  
That's what we are trying to instill in our program. As for the rest of the
Big 12, there are some great coaches across this league, and we are going to
have to have our guys ready to play every single night. And there is great
venues to play in.  
For me personally, I have taken a very different career path to get to Iowa
State than many of my counterparts across the league. I coached small college
basketball and worked my way up that way. So it is really an honor for me to
be sitting here and to have the opportunity to coach against some of the
people I am going to get to coach against in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Coach, you were talking about changing styles and maybe more man-to-man
or whatever on defense. Do you have -- right now, do you have the personnel to
do that, you believe? Or is that something that's going to take a little time
as well?  
COACH McDERMOTT: It is going to take time to get us to the point where I want
to be. We only have one scholarship senior in Jessan Gray. So it is really
important that we instill this year the way we want to play in the future. We
are going to make mistakes along the way as a result of that, but over the
long haul, it is the best for our program.  
That defensive toughness and the discipline that it takes to play on the
defensive end and not gamble and not give up second opportunities on the back
boards, not give up transition baskets and to play without fouling is
something that takes time to learn. And we have made some positive steps in
that direction in six or seven practices. Hopefully over the long haul we will
get it to where we want it to be.  
  
Q. We have talked about your new guys, but what about players like Clark and
Marsden that are coming back and have seen a lot of action. How do you like
their games with what you like to do?  
COACH McDERMOTT: First and foremost, there is a lot of turnover in our program
after I took the job and to their credit, they bought in and they wanted to be
part of what we were going to try to accomplish at Iowa State. And Rahshon
Clark has really played in the shadows of Blalock and Stinson the last couple
of years. Now this was going to be the year where it was going to be an
opportunity for him to lead and now he is leading a very young and
inexperienced team, which is a lot to put on anyone's shoulders.  
To Rahshon's credit, he has worked extremely hard. His attitude has been
terrific. He is working on parts of his game that we would like him to get
better at from a ball-handling standpoint. Rahshon has a chance to be one of
the best defensive players, one of the best I have ever coached. That's
exciting to me. Rahshon and Ross Marsden and Jessan Gray, Jiri Hubalek have
done what we asked them to do. Any time there was a coaching change as quick
as it happened at Iowa State, that's traumatic for young people to deal with.  
To their credit, they approached us with an open mind and gave us an
opportunity to build a relationship with them and to build trust in them and
it has worked out great so far.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, we wish you the best of luck. Have a great season._  
COACH McDERMOTT: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Bob Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15563)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We will get started with Texas Tech University and Coach Knight.
Coach Knight said he will go straight to questions. Coach, we will let you
take the questions._  
  
Q. Hey, Bob, good morning. Wanted to ask you, you talked a little bit about
the other coaches have you coached against. I wonder with the fact that there
are six new coaches in the league this year, do you think that's going to
change the style or does that change your approach?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think every coach brings with him something that's a little
different than the previous coach. I think where I have been, when coaches
have come in after me, they have done something a little different. When I
have gone in after coaches, we all replace a coach at some point. And we are
all replaced at some point in one way or another.  
And so I think there are always changes. But basketball is a game that has
some constant denominators in it. The quality of the defense, effectiveness of
the offense. And so those things really never change. And I don't think it is
any -- there are only so many things you can do with basketball. And whatever
is done by a new coach is usually something that has been done by previous
coaches, whether it is there or some place else. I don't think that's much of
a change.  
  
Q. Coach, how much are you going to have to rely on the new guys this year,
do you think?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think right now that we have a really good blend of players
coming back that have played a lot and new guys that are really anxious to
play. So hopefully that gives us an internal competitiveness that I think is
really necessary. And I think for us to be in any way competitive in this
league, we have got to get a lot of play from first-year players.  
  
Q. Which of the junior college guys do you think will make the biggest
impact for you this year?  
COACH KNIGHT: We have only practiced five times. I have no idea. We have got
some kids that we think can really help us, obviously. But in recruiting, you
only recruit kids that you think can really help you. Sometimes only half of
them do or none of them do or all of them do. So that changes from one year to
the next.  
At this point, I couldn't even begin to think who would come to the forefront
among the new players that we have.  
  
Q. Just a follow-up. The new 7-footer whose name I can't pronounce, is he
over the knee injury? Is he back in play?  
COACH KNIGHT: You mean the big guy? That's how I pronounce it. Esmir, he had
some real back problems his last year in junior college and he is an
absolutely great kid. He is a kid that comes back out after practice, it is a
kid that -- you know, there are some kids that you want to work with for a
long time, and every once in a while there is a kid you don't want to work
with at all. This is one of those kids that you want to as a coach, do
everything you can conceivably do to help this kid become a good player, not
just because it helps your team, but it is something the kid wants so badly.  
  
Q. Coach, how about Darryl Dora. What kind of improvement do you think he
can make this year, how much drive he has?  
COACH KNIGHT: I am not sure how much improvement he can make, but it better be
considerable.  
  
Q. Bob, you have coached against Bob Huggins. What kind of impact do you
think he will have at Kansas State?  
COACH KNIGHT: I really like Huggins as a coach because he is tough-minded and
his teams play well defensively, and he isn't afraid to go out on a limb. If
things aren't going well, he just tells kids, You got to play better.  
I really like that in a coach. He is not sitting there thinking to himself,
Well, this won't look good if I get up and get on this kid's ass or whatever,
and I like that, because he is really working to make these kids the best
players they can be. And I think he has shown that throughout the time he has
been in coaching.  
Wait a minute. I admire that in Huggins because I have kind of have always
been reluctant to get up and raise hell with a kid during my career
(laughter).  
I thought that was a good line.  
  
Q. Bob, Kansas State's almost sold out its games with the hiring of Huggins.
Can you recall when you were hired at Texas Tech and what kind of excitement
and enthusiasm there was around there at that time?  
COACH KNIGHT: Keep one thing in mind now, Kansas State has always had pretty
good crowds. And we had a really good increase in season ticket sales and
attendance when we started. And I think that's a neat thing for the players,
the coach, the school, to be enthusiastic about something like that.  
  
Q. Are you concerned about the impact the national attention will have on
your team or do you think they will embrace it?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think whatever impact this thing brings about will be like a
fly trying to bomb New York. I don't think it will have any effect whatsoever
on our players.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can talk about how Jarrius Jackson's role has evolved,
the new guys that come in and how do you think he will be this season?  
COACH KNIGHT: Let's limit it to Jackson because I think that we had to play
Jackson too much last year. We really had a problem with another guard to play
with J and we try a variety of different approaches to that. And consequently
not being able to settle on somebody that could do what we wanted done at that
other guard spot, it is almost impossible to rest Jackson. And I think it had
a tremendous effect on his play as a defensive player.  
A kid has to have rest the way the game is played, particularly today. And one
of the things that we hope we have with what we have got this year is a couple
of other guards that can give us a little bit of a rotation out there that
enables Jackson to play without being tired. And I think there were some
nights when right down to the end he is playing just as hard offensively as he
was in the beginning of the ball game, but created some real problems for us
on the defensive end.  
And I have talked to him a lot about that over the course of the summer and
into what we are doing now. And I think the key to him being a truly
outstanding, all-around player will be his defensive play. He has been a very,
very good offensive player all the time in the three years he has played for
us. I want to see him be as complete a guard as there is anywhere in the
country, and for that, as I said, he has got to be a much stronger defensive
player than he has been.  
The difference in our roster this year is such that it really enables him to
play in such a way that it isn't like I have got to take a blow and chooses to
do that on the defensive end, because that's the area that we have to improve
most in. And the two guys we have coming back that have got to show the
greatest improvement in that area to play are really Jackson and Zeno.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, they went easy on you this year._  
COACH KNIGHT: They know I would never do anything but easy. They ask questions
I don't want to answer, I just don't answer them.  
_PETER IRWIN: We wish you the best of luck for the season. Thank you very
much, coach._  
COACH KNIGHT: Peter, you are really a good guy to handle these things because
you have an understanding of coaches and the press and you have just been good
as long as I have been here. Always a pleasure to spend time.  
_PETER IRWIN: Thank you, coach._  
COACH KNIGHT: Everybody lies a little bit.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Next up this morning is Kansas State University. We would like
to welcome Coach Bob Huggins. Coach, if you would like to make an opening
comment or two._  
COACH HUGGINS: Just want to say how good it is to be here and we are certainly
excited about being in the Big 12. We look forward to the Big 12 tournament
and coming here to Oklahoma City to play.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk about how you have found the culture of
the state of Kansas and what you sense the hunger is for restoration of the K
State program?  
COACH HUGGINS: The people have been wonderful. I took the job and hadn't
really visited -- I had never been to Manhattan. I had been to Kansas many
times, but never been to Manhattan and was just really impressed with the
athletic administration and the school administration.  
People have been -- well, I grew up in a town of 500 people. Manhattan is a
big place for me. My wife grew up on a farm. I have gone pretty much
throughout the state doing the Cat-Backer events and people have turned out in
droves and been extremely supportive and I think they want to win. I think
they want to get Kansas State back among the elite programs in the country.  
  
Q. There is always a transition from one coaching staff to another. How far
along is your team at this point and what's the hardest thing you think for
them to grasp among the new things you are trying to teach?  
COACH HUGGINS: Right now we have got a lot of enthusiastic guys running into
each other, is basically what it looks like to me. I think they have really
tried. The returning guys have really tried. They have really bought in. We
conceptually are doing things a little bit different, I think. Not that we're
right and somebody else is wrong, it is just kind of the way we do things. And
they are trying. They are trying to learn. They are trying to pick it up.
Probably quite honestly, whatever it has been, five days, we have thrown a lot
of things at them.  
I don't have any issues with their effort to this point. Their effort, I
think, has been good.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of those concepts you are trying to get across? How
do you expect this team to -- what style of play do you expect to use this
year?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we are going to play a little faster, I hope. And
defensively we are going to be a little more assertive. I think they gapped a
lot of things and we are going to get out and try to dictate tempo a little
bit more with our defense, try to score a little bit more off our defense. And
try to run it up and down the floor a little bit more, create more
possessions. Hopefully we will have more possessions per game than what there
was a year ago.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys have done an outstanding job selling tickets as an
increased level of excitement and expectations are high this year. What are
your expectations this season?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we want to win. I think that's kind of why you play. This
is a great league with great coaches and great players, and we want to be able
to compete successfully in this league. And I think if you get to the point
you can compete successfully in this league then you are going to be a NCAA
tournament team. You are going to have a chance in games that you play in the
NCAA tournament.  
That's kind of what we want to do. We want to try to figure out a way that we
can compete successfully in this league, and then I think the other things
kind of follow.  
  
Q. You're one of six new coaches in the league. Can you just kind of address
all the changeover, and is that a good thing to be coming into a situation
when there is so much newness in the league?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I would like to give you an intelligent answer,
but I don't have one. I think any time there's change, I think that kind of
creates enthusiasm. I think people get enthusiastic about change for whatever
reason, just probably the newness of the situation.  
I know Mike pretty well. I have coached against Mike being in the same league
for a while, and I think the guys coming in are going to do great job. I have
seen everybody's team play. I haven't competed in a game situation with
everybody coming in, but...  
You know, they are all great schools. They are great schools with great
traditions. I think that's the thing that when you look at this league, the
thing that kind of stands out is you look at tradition of each of the schools
and there is incredible tradition. And I have just always thought if you could
do it once, why can't you do it again. And certainly every school that made a
change has a rich tradition and history.  
  
Q. Bob, what kind of impact do you expect from the three guys you
recruited?  
COACH HUGGINS: Jason and Luis make our team picture look a lot better. Those
two guys are big. Jason -- Jason is big. I'm used to being around big people
and, you know, every time Jason walks up to me or I walk up to him, I say,
Man, he is big. I mean, he is big.  
We hope that defensively he will have an impact. He has got a ways to go
offensively, but I think defensively he should have an impact. There is a lot
of him to try to score over.  
And Luis is a big, strong kid that I think will be able to rebound for us and
that's an area that we've got to spend a lot of time on and get better at.  
And then the two guards are going to be pretty much our two point guards,
Clent Stewart has kind of been out with a knee and working his way back in. So
we've got two new guys at the point, and they both play with great enthusiasm
and they are both pretty athletic. They are pretty fast.  
So, you know, I think one of the glaring weaknesses was that we didn't have
anybody who could make a play off the dribble. And I think Blake Young will be
able to make plays off the dribble.  
  
Q. Bob, we know that Cartier Martin's considered one of the premiere players
in the league. We know you had to suspend him. Just curious, how has he
adjusted to your style of play?  
COACH HUGGINS: Cartier has been terrific. Cartier in the five days that we
have had practice is very much been a leader and he has led by example. He has
led with his work ethic. I don't have any complaints with what Cartier has
given us to this point. I will probably screw him up. I will try to make him
guard and do all those other things and he won't make any shots, but I will
try not to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, being away from the game, were you anxious to get back in it? Were
you anxious for practice to get underway since you were out of coaching?  
COACH HUGGINS: I was anxious to get back in it. I was tired of being on the
road. We are in kind of a unique situation in that we pretty much have to
recruit half our team for next year, so I was out a bunch. I was just happy to
get back in. I have been pretty consumed with trying to finish off this
recruiting process. So I haven't really -- I didn't give it a whole lot of
thought until I got back in. And I scheduled -- I was scheduled to do a clinic
every day the day after I got off the road, so I was out that whole week.  
Yeah, it has been good. Getting on the floor has been good. I like being
around the guys. I think that's what -- if somebody would have asked me what I
missed, that's what I missed. I miss the camaraderie. I missed being able to
deal with the players on a day-to-day basis.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. We wish you the best of luck._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We are now ready for Texas A &M University and Billy Gillispie.
Welcome, Coach. Would you like to make an opening comment or two? _  
COACH GILLISPIE: Glad to be back. A lot of change in the conference. We are
really looking forward to a fun and exciting season. For the first time we
have some experience returning and we have some newcomers that I think will
have a major impact on our team.  
And practice has been going okay. I know no coach has gotten up here today and
said that it's going really well, but we are trying hard and we are trying to
get better and we have a long way to go and hopefully we will get there.  
  
Q. Billy, you may have talked about this, but your two kids from Seagoville,
and Bryan Davis, are they really going to have an impact?  
COACH GILLISPIE: They need to, Mike. I think that Donald Sloan and Derrick
Roland, I think as far as having toughness and athletic ability and hunger and
those kind of things, they are as far along as any freshman I have been around
in that respect. They don't know exactly where to go and how to do it, those
kind of things. But they are tough enough already. They are athletic enough
and they are strong enough and those kind of things, and I am really pleased
with how well they have done.  
And they will have to make a major impact for our team. Their athletic ability
is really going to help us. It will help us play faster, help us defensively
and rebound better and I expect great things from them.  
Bryan Davis, he reminds me a lot of Joe Jones as a freshman, and that's saying
a lot. I don't know if he will be forced to play like Joseph was as a freshman
because we didn't have too many alternatives at that point. But he has some --
he is tough like Joe and he has really good hands and he has an understanding
of how to play the game.  
So he is really a lot further along than most freshmen in a lot of different
areas. But he is in the same boat. They are all running around trying to
figure it out right now. At least they are running around fast. They are
trying hard.  
  
Q. Billy, I know last year you had a red shirt freshman that you seemed to
be excited about 6' 10 " Junior Elonu. Talk a little bit about him, and then
also a player that came so fast at the end of last year, Josh Carter, if you
could elaborate on both of those.   
COACH GILLISPIE: Chinemulu Elonu, we call him Junior, because we can't
pronounce his name. And if a coach is going to be yelling, you don't want to
be staying Chineme Elonu, and you will be mispronouncing his name and you will
get mad at yourself and they will laugh and the players will laugh even more
so, so we call him junior. He gives you quite a reason to get mad at him quite
frequently.  
He is an athletic guy that -- he is a different type guy that we don't have. I
don't think Bryan Davis will ever be a shot blocker. I don't think Joe and
Antanas is a shot blocker. Marlon is probably the best shot blocker we have.
But junior is a guy, he can block three or four shots a game if he gets an
opportunity to play that much. He is still very, very, very raw. He is still
very, very inexperienced. He started playing the game at a very late age. And
I hope he is able to make a major impact for us this year because we could use
his athletic ability inside.  
As far as -- what was your second part?  
  
Q. Josh Carter?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Josh Carter, he's grown to 6' 7 1/2" now. When I saw him as a
senior and we recruited him he is about 6' 3 1/2" legitimately. He has put on
15 or 20 pounds of muscle. His body looks a little bit thin, but he has
matured physically. And I think he will have a fantastic year. I think he will
continue to work hard and I think he will continue to emerge as one of the
better players in the Big 12 before he is done with his career.  
And he is very important to us this year because of his offensive offense
capability.  
  
Q. Billy, a couple years you had talked about getting the roster to where
you want it to be. How close is this roster to where you want it to be? Is it
a lot deeper now --  
COACH GILLISPIE: Excuse me for interrupting. It is a lot closer to being a
complete roster, but it is not there yet. And I think -- I think it takes four
or five years really because you are trying to get a program started, and then
the guys you get it started with are gone. And then you have three, four, five
guys coming in every year.  
I think it takes a while to get it exactly like you want it. But it is a more
complete roster because we have more athletic guys. And I think we are to the
point now in our recruiting to where we can start recruiting closer to needs
than just recruiting good players, and we will try to recruit good players
that fit needs now.  
So we have some short-comings. Like right now, we are not big enough on the
wing. We have some question marks about who is going to be Acie's guy who
gives him a few minutes. So hopefully we are going to be able to continue to
develop our roster so that we can have a complete roster.  
  
Q. Billy, can you just talk about the importance of having Joseph and Acie
and having that kind of experience and leadership?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It is fantastic to have them. They are great people, number
one. I love our team as far as the kind of people they are and the things that
they bring. They are such quality young men, all of them. Those two
especially. It has been so much fun to watch Acie develop into the kind of
player I thought he could become, but also into the kind of young man that he
is so pleasing to be around and he is so family oriented and he is so -- he is
such a good leader to the young players and he is just a great, great, great
young man. It has been fun to watch him develop into that kind of guy.  
Yesterday, he had to go to a study session and he had to leave practice early.
And I think we have some other good players on our team. I was thinking, man
alive, I don't want him to leave. It is going to be too soon before he is
gone.  
Joe is the same kind of guy. He is one of the best young men I have ever been
around. We have had a lot of people come in and watch practice as far as we
have had some scouts come in. We have had a lot of high school coaches. We
have had a lot of folks come in, and every time, they have something to say
about those guys, as well as all of our other guys. They talk about how good a
people they are.  
When people want to talk about turn-arounds and those kinds of things, it is
all about character qualities and eliminating distractions. And these guys put
their hard hat on every day and they eliminate distractions such as missing --
they don't miss class. I am talking about our entire team.  
Now you can get down to the work, okay? Now we are going to work to get better
because we don't have any distractions. And those two guys provide so much
leadership for us, they won't let anybody mess up. It is really, really nice
to have that on your team.  
This is the first year, John, we have really had any older leadership -- I
mean, experienced leadership. These guys were young and they were forced to do
it at an early age, but now we have some guys that have been around for two or
three years and that experienced leadership is even better than any other
kind.  
  
Q. Billy, the Big 12 has won national championships in just about everything
but basketball. Does the league need to win a NCAA basketball championship to
stop that from becoming an issue?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I didn't know that we hadn't, and I didn't know it was an
issue.  
  
Q. I am not saying it is. The people are starting to wonder. Do you think,
Stop it before it becomes an issue?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I don't know. I don't know how those things go or whatever. I
know that the Big 12 is very, very, very highly respected in every basketball
circle, and so I know it is with fans. I know it is with media. I know it is
with players. Players really want to play in the Big 12. As we evolve into, I
guess, our 11th year, is that right, I think it will continue to get better
and better and better.  
10 or 15 years ago, guys would leave the state at a much higher rate. In our
particular state, guys would leave the region, the Big 12 corridor or whatever
up I-35, I think they probably looked for different outlets to be exposed more
or whatever.  
I think now they say, Well, the Big 12 is good enough. You don't have to go
anywhere else, and why would they? The more good players you have and the more
high-quality coaches that you have, and they have always had great coaches,
but it continues to get better and better.  
Somebody will win a national championship before too long, and it could be
this year. We are always in the final -- I don't know all the details of it.
But I know that somebody is always in the Final 4 or Elite 8 every single
year. We get a lot of exposure.  
It would be nice to have that crown.  
  
Q. Billy, can you talk a little bit about the atmosphere at A &M now, the
basketball atmosphere, how that has changed since have you been there?   
COACH GILLISPIE: I think everyone was willing to give us a chance when we
first started, but they didn't really know what to expect. And so we kind of
hit it like a tornado in there and came hard and just going and going.  
And I think people kind of -- they have embraced us from day one. But I think
that they were thinking, Man alive, what's going on over here?  
So when we started to win, I think that people started to get excited, but I
think it was kind of cautious a little bit. Again, they still didn't know what
to expect.  
I think now people have really started to believe. I am talking about on
campus, I am talking about in the community and I am talking about all the
Aggies everywhere. And I think they are all really excited. I feel a real
certain buzz everywhere you go.  
People are excited about our basketball program and our team in particular. It
has been fun to watch that. It has been fun for me as a coach to see how our
players react to the buzz. And it has also been fun for me to see a lot of old
Aggies out there all over the place that are really excited about basketball,
maybe for the first time in a long, long time.  
It has been fun to see their excitement grow.  
  
Q. Why don't you talk a little bit about the upgrade and the schedule, and
obviously you feel this team is ready for that, if you have got those teams on
the schedule like LSU and UCLA.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Yeah. I was going to scold you all for not asking that
question because you all got after us pretty good the last two years about the
schedule - and rightfully so, though. You all are always right. I am saying it
is rightfully so.  
Just about that, Richard, our philosophy is exactly the same as it was on the
schedule. Our philosophy was, Let's try to do what we can to prepare our team
to play in conference.  
That's what we did two years ago. That's what we did last year and that's what
we did this year. And the names of the teams have changed quite drastically,
but the philosophy I think will always remain the same, Let's try to get ready
to play in conference.  
I think we have a very, very dangerous schedule. I think we have too many hard
games on our schedule and I think the two teams that you mentioned, I think
that's -- quite obvious that's what everyone would kind of want to focus on
when we talk about our schedule, is UCLA and LSU in the same week.  
And the danger is your first game is always hard. Then you are playing Lamar
and Louisiana Tech and St. Louis and our first Shelby Metcalf Classic, and
then you are playing Ohio State, he is a new coach and brings a lot of
excitement. He has won three national championships in the junior college
ranks.  
And then you are playing Arkansas, Little Rock which has the rebounding leader
in the NCAA returning. And then you are playing Pacific who whipped us last
year. And then you got Fordham and Winthrop who had Tennessee knocked out as a
two-seed last year and they have five of their top guys coming back.  
Auburn was a freshman and sophomore team last year. Now they are sophomores
and juniors and we had to barely scrape by at home. I think it is easy to
focus on two games, but I think we would be foolish to do so.  
The entire 14-game schedule will be very difficult for us. Even though we do
have some experience, it is going to be very, very, very difficult for us to
come through it the right way, I would think.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. We wish you the best of luck for the
season._  
COACH GILLISPIE: Thanks, everybody. Good to see everybody again.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We would like to welcome Coach Scott Drew from Baylor
University. Coach, welcome to the podium. We will take -- if you would make an
opening comment or two and then we will take questions._  
COACH DREW: I know we are an excited bunch this year. We get to play right
away and the easiest way to sum that up would be probably to say no one is
looking more forward to a nonconference schedule than our team this year,
having a full set of scholarships for the first time and ready to go. So with
that, I had the Starbucks this morning, so questions?  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. A year ago at this time we were asking you what will it was
like not having a preseason. You gave your best prediction you could. Now
looking back on it, what was it like, all that process?  
COACH DREW: Definitely wouldn't recommend it for anybody. The biggest and the
toughest thing was not playing games when the games started and watching
everybody. But once the games actually did start, you are so far behind,
everybody else and the expectations are so high and you are so excited for
those first couple games and now you are out there and not performing at what
you thought you were capable of doing.  
That really was an even bigger let-down than early in the year when people
started playing and you felt that withdraw of not being able to play.  
So the first couple months was pretty tough on the guys. Finally, about the
second half of conference, we were able to get our legs under us, get caught
up to game speed and be able to be more competitive and obviously finish on a
better note.  
  
Q. Scott, I wonder if you can talk about the change in coaching throughout
this conference. Are you kind of excited about going against some new guys and
what do you think it will mean for the Big 12?  
COACH DREW: We have had so many things to concentrate on at Baylor University,
we really haven't had time to focus on everybody else. In the Big 12 you will
always have great coaches. You will always have great players and you will
have great fan support. None of that changes. We are just excited to be more
competitive to play against these schools now.  
  
Q. Scott, a lot of talk about your three newcomers. What have you seen
there?  
COACH DREW: Well, the great thing is all three are different and all three can
definitely help us in different ways this season, starting with Tweety Carter.
Any time you get nicknames as players, you know you are pretty good. Tweety,
Demond Carter is someone who can really score as he has a good feel for the
game. Being someone that has played so many AU tournaments and all-star games
and all the exposure he has gotten, he is ready to step in and have a chance
to play right away and not be in awe of college or the Big 12.  
And then you have Penny, Djibril Thiam. He is someone that has grown eight
inches in the last three years. Coaches always hear about players growing and
somehow when we recruited them in the past, they never did grow. But this is
different because we had a 6' 1" point guard when we first looked at him and
now he is 6' 9". So we are excited with the different things he can do.  
Basically at 6' 9" with those kind of perimeter skills, he gives us someone
who is a match-up problem for people. And the big guy in the middle, Josh
Lomers, at 7', 265, gives Mamadou someone to go against every day in practice.
And because of his size and strength, he is definitely someone that will do
well in the Big 12. No nickname for him. So we got to work on that.  
  
Q. You guys and Texas A &M are picked higher than ever in the coaches polls.
Why do you think your two programs in particular have been able to recruit the
way you have in a short period of time. What does that say about the players
that are out there, and now the competition in the Big 12 with more and more
teams being competitive?   
COACH DREW: I know with Baylor University, you have a school that has a lot to
offer. I know Texas A&M has a lot to offer. And especially in the area that we
are located, there is a lot of good talent and now players are choosing to
stay close to home. That definitely helps you attract that kind of talent.  
Also, I think you bring in some good players and then other players want to
play with those players. So in our situation, you bring in someone like Aaron
Bruce and other players, you see him being successful his freshman year and
they want to play with him and that has helped as well.  
  
Q. Scott, I wonder if you could talk about Aaron's role with this team and
how it has evolved over the two years it has been in your program?  
COACH DREW: Aaron is somebody, again, when he came to Baylor he was asked to
do so much as far as especially scoring. And because of how hard he plays and
with what passion he plays, I think it attracted other recruits and other
people to Baylor University. It has elevate other players on the team to play
with that kind of passion and excitement.  
Now, I think as we have gotten better and better personnel around Aaron, one
of his best attributes is his passing. And I think, again, each year his
scoring might go down, but his numbers will go, up especially with the assist.  
Now we are working on cutting down the turnovers because sometimes he likes to
make those passes -- I mean, he is used to playing in the world championships.
We got good players, but we might not have Andrew Bogut just yet, so we are
trying to work on that ratio right now.  
  
Q. Coach, is it a different feeling not being the team that's picked at the
bottom of the league like your first three years? First three years people are
like, Oh, they are Baylor, they are going through growing pains, and now they
are talking you might have a chance to go the post-season?  
COACH DREW: I think it is a compliment to our players and how far the program
has come in a short period of time. I think every coach and person associated
with athletics will tell you the preseason polls don't matter half as much as
the post-season. What we are doing is concentrating on where we finish up and
how we prepare to get ready to do that. It is a great sign of respect for our
program and just how far it has come and we take that very appreciably.  
  
Q. Scott, we know with Curtis Jerrells, Aaron Bruce, now Tweety Carter, you
got the perimeter game to play with anybody in the Big 12. Has your inside
scoring ability improved along with the perimeter?  
COACH DREW: I know each year with big guys, they tend to mature a little bit
slower than the guards sometimes and each year, the Mamadous and Kevin Rogers
and our inside players will continue to get better and better, especially with
the strength and conditioning part of it. Charlie Melton, our strength coach
has done an excellent job.  
So again each year, I expect them to continue to improve and get better. As
far as right now, I think they will benefit more from that nonconference
schedule than anybody else on our team from the standpoint they will have a
chance to hopefully get some confidence in the nonconference schedule rather
than going up against the Big 12 big guys they had to go up against last year.
And, again, every year they should improve.  
  
Q. Scott, in terms of the post-season, I wonder, how much are you talking to
the guys about those four magic letters, NCAA? How much are you talking to
them about the tournament? That's clearly the goal.  
COACH DREW: I think right now the guys are just trying to survive practices.
The first couple days of practice, you know you are never in good of shape as
the coach wants you to be. Right now "practice over" is what they want to hear
more than "NCAA" right now. I think it is a situation whereas we start to play
-- get closer to game time and we play our exhibition games, we will sit down
and come up with our team goals and what we would like to achieve this year
and see where we are at that point.  
Good thing we don't have any injuries yet. That's always a good thing for
coaches early in the year.  
  
Q. Coach, with all the perimeter players, could we see something like
Villanova did last year where you have four guards out on the court at the
same time?  
COACH DREW: That is definitely an option and I think with more and more
schools, seeing the success at Villanova and some programs that have played
three guards have had, I think that leads to more and more guards being
played. So that's definitely an option for us. It is nice to have options for
once, too.  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay, coach. We wish you the best of luck for the season. Thank
you very much._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Without further ado we would like to introduce Jeff Capel from
Oklahoma University. Coach, welcome to the Big 12._  
COACH CAPEL: I appreciate it. Excited to be here this morning. Good morning to
everyone. Excited to be the head coach of the University of Oklahoma. We are
looking forward to this season. Our guys have been working very hard in
practice and our individual skill work on trying to learn a new system and a
different way to play. We feel like we are making progress. It is going to be
a journey. We look forward to taking each step and making a commitment to
becoming the best team we can be.  
  
Q. Have you figured out what you are going to do when one of your starters
gets in foul trouble?  
COACH CAPEL: I really haven't. That's something you can't find out that much,
I think, until you get in game situations. First of all, it is really hard
because I don't know who our starters are right now. We have yet to identify
who our starting five will be. I think as we get closer to our first game,
then we will be able to make that identification of who our starting five will
be and then try to figure out some sort of rotation. But right now it is a
little bit too early to figure that out.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked about when you fist got the job how you wanted to take
some time to learn who your players were and what their skill levels were.
What do you know now about your team that you didn't know when you got the
job?  
COACH CAPEL: It is still a learning process. We are still trying to do that,
trying to make proper evaluations. That takes time.  
When I was hired, I had two weeks where I could work with our guys. And then
also, obviously, in the summer we didn't have any opportunity to be on the
floor with them. And then once we started back, we can do things up until
September 15th. In a four-man setting at the most and then from the 15th on to
the 13th of October, we can do things in a team setting.  
At the same time, I was doing a lot of recruiting out on the road and so we
are still trying to learn -- I'm still trying to learn. What I have seen is
that, first and foremost, I have never once in a practice, in an individual
workout had to implore our team to play harder. Our guys play really, really
hard. I think there is a sense of togetherness with this group in trying to
prove something. And that's exciting.  
Now, we still have a lot of work to do. Like I say, you are implementing a
completely different style of play, especially on the offensive end. And so it
is almost like having a team full of new guys because we're a new coaching
staff and getting our guys used to playing a certain way, changing some habits
and that takes time. And we understand that. We are being patient. But we have
seen progress so far.  
That's what you want as a coach. You want to see progress. You want guys
working hard. You want guys that are committed to being a part of something
bigger than them, and that's what Oklahoma basketball is about and we look
forward to the journey.  
We understand that hopefully we will be a better team as the season goes on. I
would like to be a really good team right now, but that probably -- if you
watched us right now, we are not a really good team. We have some really good
parts. We have to work really hard to come -- to become a very good basketball
team, and that's what our plan is, to be the best team we can be.  
  
Q. Coach, how much has your four years playing at Duke influenced your game
style of play and your coaching philosophy?  
COACH CAPEL: It has somewhat. My time at Duke influenced me as a man, not just
me as a coach or not that. Obviously you have to -- I think as a coach, you
have to have a certain way you want to play, but you have to adopt to your
personnel. Because of that, I think you change every year. Even if you have a
whole team back, hopefully you change because hopefully your players have
gotten better.  
I am a big believer if your players aren't getting better, to me they are
getting worse because they are not improving.  
With our group, we have some guys back, but we did lose a lot. We have some
new pieces and with these new guys we will have to depend on those guys and
with that -- they are freshmen. There may be a day they look pretty good and
the next day they look like freshman. Hopefully we can get some consistency
out of them and work really hard.  
My time at Duke experienced me as a person, experienced me as a man, the
relationships I developed there, the things that I learned go well beyond the
basketball court. There are things I have been able to apply to my life.
Obviously I share some of those things with our team and with the young men
that I coach, but also that's heavily influenced by my father, by my time at
VCU, by my experiences as a head coach. And I look forward to bringing all of
that here to the University of Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Jeff, being new, you haven't had to coach in the Big 12 tournament in
Kansas City or in Dallas. Just your thoughts on being able to play this year
across the street in the Ford Center?  
COACH CAPEL: We are excited about it. We are excited about being here in
Oklahoma City, having our tournament here. Hopefully we can have a great
turnout of fans coming out to support the sooners. I am a little bit used to
somewhat of a conference tournament being at kind of your home. When I was at
VCU our conference tournament every year was in Richmond, it was eight blocks
down the road and so that's something that kind of gives you somewhat of an
advantage.  
You know what? It doesn't really matter when you get to that point. You have
to be a good team and you have to play better than the team you are playing.
And that's our goal is to continue each day to get better, each day to improve
as a basketball team to get closer, to show improvement and we look forward to
when we get to that point, where it is the Big 12 tournament not to have to
travel a great distance and be right here in our own backyard and hopefully
that gives us some help.  
  
Q. Coach, I know OU has taken steps to make sure you are in compliance with
all NCAA rules. How much will the probation, the sanctions, the scholarship
reductions add to your challenge?  
COACH CAPEL: You know what, it's -- I don't think we don't anticipate it being
any hindrance that much at all. Our University and athletic department self-
imposed sanctions, and the NCAA took those rules -- really this is the last
year of it. We are in the last year of the self-imposed sanctions of the
scholarship reductions and some of the phone-call restrictions. We understand
and we want to be in compliance.  
That's something our University and athletic department, we understand that.
There was a mistake made and that's what it was, a mistake. And we look
forward to doing everything in compliance with the rules right now. We don't
anticipate it hurting us. We try to get the information out there to recruits,
to coaches, the right information because they are not getting right
information from other places.  
They have a perception of what it is and wherever they are getting that from.
We try to let them know immediately that what they are hearing about what's
going on in our program is not true. These are the facts. We try to get them
the facts. We try to verbalize it to them. We try to get it to them on paper
so they can know the truth.  
A lot of times they are really surprised once they hear the truth because they
think it is a lot worse. So I don't anticipate it hurting us that much.  
  
Q. Jeff, I wonder if you can talk about the response you have had back from
some of the walk-ons that have come and want to make your team and how much do
you really expect those guys to be able to contribute this year to you guys?  
COACH CAPEL: We had walk-on tryouts last Sunday, and really to be honest with
you, I wasn't there. I was at home with my wife enjoying the rest of our
afternoon. Our guys had a great practice on Sunday and we had gone twice on
Saturday. Because we had such a really good practice, I just went home and
enjoyed the rest of the day.  
We do walk-on tryouts, do it every year. And I do it for a couple of reasons.
I do it because you never know who you have on campus. With our team this
year, what we were hoping for, what we wished for is that you had a 6' 8" guy
magically appear. Unfortunately for us, that didn't happen. Maybe a little bit
later that will happen for us. But it didn't happen.  
We have had tryouts every year. Whether we keep a guy or not is something that
I think is good. We haven't made a decision yet on whether we will bring
someone back for another tryout or go back. But obviously you have to go
through compliance issues with that.  
Because of that, we only had four guys that could try out because they were
the ones going through the proper channels and getting in compliance to be
able to try out. So we will make a decision going forward on whether it is
something we -- on whether there is a young man or young men that we want to
keep.  
  
Q. Jeff, as a first-year Big 12 head coach, is it comforting or what's your
thought on half the league being in the same position as you as a first-year
coach in this league?  
COACH CAPEL: It is what it is, to be honest with you. It is what it is. That's
just the way it happened this year. I am a first-year coach in this league,
but I am not a first-year head coach. I have head coaching experience and so I
am going to lean on that for this. This is just a different conference, but
basketball is basketball.  
I am a big believer in that. I am a big believer in trying to teach our guys
the fundamentals. And really to be honest you, the only team I'm worried about
is Oklahoma. I am not worried about anyone else. My focus and all of my energy
is on Oklahoma. I think it is exciting for the league that you have new
coaches because you -- it is exciting because you don't know what it is going
to be.  
Sometimes that's exciting. The unknown is exciting sometimes. But for me, my
focus is on OU. My focus is on our program and us becoming the best team we
can. Our focus is on trying to help Mike Neal have a great senior year, have
Nate Carter have a great senior year, trying to help our freshmen become
acclimated to college basketball, the pace of it, the speed of it, how hard
you have to work. That's where my focus is.  
My focus is not -- this is no disrespect. My focus is not on Mike Anderson, on
Coach Huggins, on Doc Sadler. I hope those guys have a great time. I hope they
are really working hard with their team, and I am sure they are.  
My sole focus is on the University of Oklahoma. That's my job. And that's my
passion right now. So that's all I am thinking about, is us becoming the best
team we can be and trying to figure out things we have to do as a coaching
staff to help our players be in position to attain success.  
  
Q. Jeff, a lot of people look at Taylor Griffin as a guy who is about ready
to emerge as a player in this conference. What have you seen of him?  
COACH CAPEL: Taylor has probably been our most consistent guy in practice. I
think he's had really good practices since we started. He is a talented young
man. He works hard. The thing that I love about him is that he doesn't try to
do things that he is not comfortable doing.  
So because of that, I think that's the reason why he has been the most
consistent guy. He has been able to knock in open shots in practice. He plays
with a passion. He is determined. He defends, he rebounds. He is a great
communicator -- he has been a really good communicator for us on the floor.  
He has really made strides in this game, and I think sometimes what you see --
every player -- and I am a big believer in this, every player always wants a
big opportunity. There is very seldom players that think all players want a
bigger chance, they want a bigger piece of the equation of having the chance
to have a bigger impact. The thing I told our guys when I was hired, All of
you have the opportunity now. The thing that you have to do -- the thing we
have to do, we have to prepare for. We can't expect for it to happen. Whatever
it is, we can't expect it to happen. We have to prepare to make something
positive happen.  
Taylor did a great job -- not a good job, he did a great job from the time I
was hired to really working on his game, doing things to try to get better.
Did a great job of trusting us, trusting me as a coach and the things I
thought he needed to work on. So because of that, I think Taylor will have a
good year. We will need him to have a really good year for us.  
And I think he has positioned his self to have that kind of year. Whether it
is a breakout year or what, we expect Taylor to have a good year and to have a
really positive impact on our program and on our basketball team.  
_PETER IRWIN: Thank you very much, Coach. We appreciate it. We wish you the
best for the season._  
COACH CAPEL: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: At this time, we would like to welcome Rick Barnes from the
University of Texas. He says he is going to go straight to questions, right?_  
COACH BARNES: Right.  
  
Q. I mentioned a while ago I talked to a couple of guys about impressions of
the loveable Rick Barnes after a week of practice. How do you think your young
guys have taken to it? Have you been pleased with their reaction?  
COACH BARNES: I have been, and I think probably the fact that, again, my
coaches do a great job I think getting them ready for it. When we get up there
and the intensity raises a little bit, I think some of them probably go up
there a little bit scared maybe, wondering how hard, can we get through this,
can I do this practice.  
The one thing I can say is they have gotten better every day. And defensively
the first day we weren't very good. The energy has been high every day. But
the fact is, I think for seven new guys up there and only four guys coming
back that have been there a year basically, they have done okay. They have
done okay.  
  
Q. Rick, after seeing Dexter Pittman in the Texas high school all-star game
this summer, I am really intrigued with his ability. Could you talk a little
bit about him and how he is developing.  
COACH BARNES: Well, you know, he has lost half a person, because he has really
lost about 70 pounds now. I am not sure anybody in our program is more proud
of him than all of us, the fact of how he has to work so hard just physically
changing his body. He got on the scales after our first practice and his goal
was -- our goal really was to have him at 320 or so when we started practice.
And he started out at 315. Actually he is at 313. After his first practice he
was 308.  
When I first recruited Dexter -- when you are recruiting somebody, you don't
get so much in depth about what you are going to do to them. I said, Dex, how
much do you need to weigh to be successful?  
He said, I think 340.  
I said, Why 340?  
He said, That's what Shaq weighs.  
I said, Shaq is a little bigger than you.  
He said, Okay, 335.  
Once we got him in the program and he signed his national letter of intent. We
got serious and we told him we wanted him at 280. If you ask him today, he
would say he wants to be 260. He has changed his outlook on everything.  
To do what he has done is really hard in the time it has done it. It will help
him as a player. He would tell you -- I asked him yesterday before I left, he
sleeps better at night. He has much more energy. When you watched him play and
when you recruited him, what impressed you was how well he carried 370 pounds.
How quick he was. He has got great hands. Anything that's close he is going to
catch. He is quick, believe it or not. You can say, how does a guy that size
be quick? He was.  
His only problem was he go up and down the floor twice. Now he is learning to
go from play to play to play. It has been fun watching his progress. How much
he helps us this year, I don't know. We just know he still has to continue to
get himself into shape that he needs to be in this year, because our team is a
little bit different this year, the way we are playing.  
We do think he will help and we think he can help us this year.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys lost quite a bit from last year, but you brought
in D.J., Kevin, Matt Hill and a few other guys. How pleased have you been with
them during practice and what do you expect from those guys this year even
though they are so long?  
COACH BARNES: We lost a lot. We lost our whole team. That means we are putting
together our team this year. Connor Atchley has been in the program, this is
his third year. He is a red shirt sophomore right now. But A.J. Abrams has
been there one year. Craig Winder, one year, and J.D. Lewis, one year. In
terms of guys in the program, now we bring in seven new freshman.  
What we don't have right now as in the past where our older players really did
a lot of coaching with the younger players. These guy have tried hard to do
it. A.J. Abrams' role has changed. He is trying to help D.J. Augustin, those
guys probably talked, kind of what Mike was talking about, when you have a lot
of young freshman coming up, they are really skeptical or concerned about what
is practice going to be about. Because they have heard it is hard, it is
tough, it is demanding. They go from being on the floor with you for an hour
to maybe 2 and a half, 3 hours.  
That's where your older players come in and say, Look, it will be tough, but
it is nothing you can't do.  
So those guys have been thrust in a role of leadership probably more so than
they probably would have, but -- this freshman group came in, Damion James
might be the most durable freshman we've had. Kevin Durant has lost weight.
D.J. Augustin has lost weight, Dexter has lost weight. Everybody had something
to do.  
They came in as a close group. The summer was great for them, and they haven't
lost their enthusiasm at all to where we are right now.  
I do think each day they are understanding the commitment that it takes to be
successful at this level.  
  
Q. Rick, with the focus on getting Pittman's weight down, how is he just in
terms of strength? Do you work on getting the weight down and then building
him back up or how does that whole process go?  
COACH BARNES: Randy, that's where he plateaued a little bit. Our goal was to
get his weight down to 320 before we really started a, what I would say is a
lifting program. Todd Wright, there is nobody better at what he does. Todd was
so concerned -- first of all, when you have that weight, that in itself doing
just something as simple as a step up, you are carrying a lot of weight.  
Once we got him into the lifting program, the muscle weight obviously slowed
it down a little bit. But then he got where he wanted to continue to drop. So
he even went back to doing more cardio work and his diet has changed
tremendously. He has totally changed that part of his life and the way he goes
about it.  
The neatest part of Dexter Pittman, when you are around somebody and you see
him change the way he has changed, he really feels good about himself. He is
really strong obviously.  
We think as we do get further into the weight program with him, he will
continue to really sculpt and train his body more so than it is right now. His
energy level is much higher. His high school coach was in practice last week
and he said, I honestly cannot believe the things he is doing. I just can't
believe it.  
He said, obviously being around Dexter a long time, he said some of the things
he is doing right now, he would never believe he could do, and one of them
being the way he is continuing to run and run and standing in practice,
changing ends of the floor, which is a big part of this game.  
  
Q. Last year Kansas had a very young team and was able to gel in time to
make a nice run. Can your young team do the same thing this season?  
COACH BARNES: I don't know. I know our nonleague schedule is really -- I think
it is going to help us. I just hope we can get our share of wins with it. I
think the way -- we could have cut it back and won some games. I just felt
like for us to be the team we want to be in conference play that we were going
to have to challenge these guys early and hopefully we haven't overchallenged
them.  
Again, I don't know. I can't think that far ahead. I think by the time we get
to conference play, I just hope we are healthy and that we have got an idea of
what we need to do and we are willing to do the things that we have to do to
win.  
  
Q. Obviously one of the big topics this year is six new coaches in the Big
12. Have you ever been part of a conference that has had this much changeover?
What are your thoughts on it?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I mean, everybody talks about it, but I don't think it is
any different than when you are a coach coming in. When I came into the league
nine years ago, there were 11 new coaches as far as I was concerned.  
I don't think you worry about it like that. I think you are going to be -- by
the time we get to conference play, we will have enough tape and film of
people that we will know what they are trying to do and their schemes and
things. It gets back to players. You are going to worry more about the players
and the coaches.  
I can only say if coaches have come into this league and they have had great
success, which we know every new coach has had or they wouldn't be in this
league or they wouldn't have a chance to coach at this level if they hadn't
had success along the way. I have always believed the game is about players,
and I still believe that. Coaches come and go, as do players. Every year you
start over. Like our team would have been different -- if our entire team came
back and we had the addition of some of the guys, we couldn't have had them
all but we had some of them, our team would be different even with returning
players.  
I would have had to change some as a coach. Every year there are changes that
go on even, if there aren't outwardly changes with the coaches in the league.
Six new ones in the league, I don't know it has ever happened before or not. I
haven't really thought a lot about it from that perspective.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, did a good job. Thank you very much. Have a great
season._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2006

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We are ready to start with University of Missouri. We would like
to welcome Coach Mike Anderson, not only to the podium, but also to the
league. Welcome, coach._  
COACH ANDERSON: Thank you. Thank you very much. It is an exciting time for
Mike Anderson and his family and hopefully it is going to be an exciting time
for our Missouri Tigers. Hopefully we are in the process of practice number 12
with our basketball team, and so you can see we are trying to get ready to
open up the '06-'07 year.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like your style of play is going to catch a couple of
teams off guard this year because it is something the Big 12 hasn't seen?  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, it is a brand of basketball. I played at Oklahoma State
last year. I played Nebraska. You have some teams that are familiar with us at
the same time, and probably have some teams that have not.  
But it's a style of play we hope to play. Initially it might not be the full
40 minutes, but at the same time it will be a team that is going to compete
and it is going to be a process, a team that's going to find its own identity.  
I say right now, if you look at our basketball team, it will be like a box of
Cracker Jacks. When you open the Cracker Jacks, you know there is a surprise
and you don't know what the surprise is going to be. It is a team that will
continue to work hard, and that's what I like about our guys. The attitude,
they are really, really working hard and trying to get on the same page in
terms of the coaching staff as well as with their teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any -- are you concerned about any height issues? I know
your team is very fast break, but your team -- your tallest player on your
team is 6' 9 ", and it reminds me a lot of the early teams at Arkansas when
you had Oliver Miller as your tallest player?   
COACH ANDERSON: Well, it is a concern. Size is a concern. You can't teach
size. At the same time, you can't teach heart. And when you watch our
basketball team, it is going to be a team that's going to leave its heart out
on the floor. And you can't be concerned about what you don't have. I think
you have to deal with what you have.  
And so we have a complement of players that can hopefully complement each
other and also learn a new system. When you look at our basketball team, you
talk about -- you are talking about a team that was held over from last year.
You are bringing in six new players and you got a new coaching staff. There is
a lot of newness and so you are trying to get that newness and become familiar
with one another. That's the huge -- the greatest challenge.  
But, again, size is going to be a problem at times, but then again, hopefully
we can get the tempo going the way we want to, that is not magnified.  
  
Q. Coach, every coach we have talked to today, especially the new guys, have
talked about what great coaching there is in this league. I mean, it is true,
of course. Do you look around and maybe not feel intimidated, that's not the
right word, but very challenged when you see you are going up again the Bob
Huggins, the Bill Self, the Bob Knight?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think when I first came into the league at UAB, there was
some great coaches in that league. When you talk about Cincinnati, Louisville,
Marquette, I was a new head coach. But at the same time, I think -- I draw on
my experiences, I think, more than maybe other coaches do.  
I was at Arkansas. I did a lot of things that head coaches do. So it was not a
problem for me when we faced those teams. I think the most important thing is
the players are going to be playing on the floor. The coaches, what we do is
we manage people. You try to get the right combinations out there. So from
that standpoint, I am one of those guys that, my attitude about work, you tell
me if I got to get up at 6:00 a.m. in the morning to win five more games,
we're there. So I take that analogy about myself.  
I don't want to be like Nolan Richardson. I want to be better than Nolan
Richardson. That's just me. If you see me in a fight with a bear, you better
help the bear.  
There is no intimidation. I don't think any coach should get up here and say
they are. I hope they are not, anyway. I know I have a challenge in front of
me. We are in a great league in the Big 12, and there are some great coaches
in this league. At the same time, I am confident as we get our program to
where I want it, we will be able to keep. I want to win a national
championship. That's my quest.  
Hopefully, the Big 12, the nonconference schedule, at some point in time will
prepare us to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of following up on what you just said, do you see your
players taking that kind of attitude and wanting to get up at 6:00 to win that
extra game and things like that?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think they have. I think if you ask our guys, it's been
grueling. It's been grueling. They have worked extremely hard. It started when
school started. We had individual workouts. You have two hours in the week
that you can do individual workouts. We kind of spread ours up into 30-minute
segments, four days a week. They didn't think I could get a lot done in 30
minutes. You can get a lot done in 30 minutes.  
So we have just taken that mind-set each and every day that they come on the
court. They will be on the floor. When people see our basketball team, they
always ask, Why do they play so hard? That's all they know. So with the weight
training, the same emphasis.  
Of course, our practice, we have been practicing two a day. I don't like to
get up at 6:00 in the morning all the time, I will tell you that. And I know
our guys don't. In order to have a chance to be successful, you have to pay a
price. I have always felt that way. And so if you tell me we are going to be
there at 6:00, we are there, our team is there. For the most part, our guys
have taken on that mind-set that they don't mind. Of course, they don't know,
but they don't mind.  
As they do it and they start seeing some of the results -- like right now,
they are starting to see that some of the conditioning is paying off because
now they can go a little longer in practice. And our practices are brutal.  
When we get to the games, hopefully that's going to be fun. But our practices
are brutal because of the preparation that we put into it. It is not easy.
When people see us play, it is harder to play the way we play than it is to
the A, the B, the C, the D. If you come to all of our practices, I think you
will see that we put in a lot of time. We actually do.  
Hopefully, in the end, we'll see if it will pay off. Of course, history has
shown that it has paid off for the teams, whether it be at Tulsa when I
played, whether it be at Arkansas where I coached, whether it be at UAB. It
has paid off. Again, it has been the mind-set we have at Missouri and it will
be a process, especially with this basketball team.  
The guys are working, that's all I want them to do, continue to work.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the challenges of teaching the guys that haven't played
that style, to teach them how to play your style?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think, number one, forget everything they already know - not
everything, but I think basketball is still a game of fundamentals: passing,
catching, defending, rebounding, screening, talking, communicating. Basketball
is still the fundamentals.  
I think those are some things that these guys have done and done extremely
well. Now, we are talking about we are going to do it at a rapid pace. There
is up-tempo, but we want to be up, up and away tempo.  
So we have got to get these guys in the mind-set that the game is played --
the way I want to play is with instinct. You use your God-gifted abilities and
it is instinctive. And it is unselfishness. You are going to play unselfish
basketball, defensive. Because of our defensive pressure: the trapping, the
rotating. I got to trust that my teammates have got my back if I go double up.
I gotta trust that that's going to take place.  
I think that's the hard part because every possession -- it is just like a kid
coming from a high school. When they come to the collegiate level, they don't
know that you got to play every possession like it is almost your last.  
With us, you have to play every possession as hard as you can. And at the same
time, you are going to make mistakes, and the best way to make mistakes is
make up for our hustling. We will get it back on the other end.  
It is attack basketball. Offensively and defensively. It is nonstop. It is
like -- I call it controlled chaos. That's what it is, controlled chaos.
People may call it running. It is not running. It is run and we execute. When
you watch our team, hopefully that's what you will see.  
Now, probably in the first month or so, if you are one of those guys, I don't
know whether the media sits, but if you sit in the front row, you better wear
helmets because some of the passes may be hitting you.  
It is a process we will clean up and we will get better at it. We will get
better at it.  
  
Q. Your returning leading returning scorer is Marshall Brown and we have
watched him for a couple years. He has never appeared to tap into his
potential. Could you talk a little bit more about his abilities?  
COACH ANDERSON: It is interesting that you say that. I was telling some guys
earlier, Marshall probably had one of his better workouts yesterday. I think
Marshall is a conditioned player. He is oozing with athletic ability. And I
think confidence is big in anything you do, I think confidence.  
And I think that's the thing I want these guys to do, when they play the game,
they don't play it thinking. They play it just reacting and having confidence
in their abilities.  
He is a run-and-jump guy. I think with the way we are going to play, it is
going to benefit him as long as he understands the things we were doing. And
we started with our defense.  
But I think you are going to see a guy that's going to be doing a lot more
things. He will be up and down the floor. He will be getting some stick-backs.
He will be getting some alley hoops. He'll be blocking guy's shots. He will be
touching and deflecting balls. When you look at -- again, not only Marshall,
but hopefully our whole basketball team, you will see a blue collar team.
That's going to play -- they are going to play with their hearts. They are
going to play together. Again, they are going to share.  
People wonder right now where is the scoring going to come from? I have no
idea. I think we will be a team that's hopefully going to be balanced. We got
a lot of people. With the way we play, I think our bench is going to be huge.
It is going to be huge in terms of what we do. We have probably one of the
best bench, I thought, in the last four years at UAB. At times, they outscored
the starters. So sometimes it is not all about starting, it is about those
guys coming off the bench, what are they giving our basketball team.  
And on any given night, there is not a whole lot, I think, difference in the
talent level in our basketball team. So it is going to be a different guy
every night giving us something, and so I think those are what you call true
teams.  
  
Q. Who do you think is going to have the biggest impact for you?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think what has taken place, I think last year with Missouri,
they probably have one or two guards and I think we have got some --
competition is great for a basketball team, and so when you talk about guys
like Stefhon Hannah coming in, J.T. Tiller coming in, Keon Lawrence, those
guys coming in. And we got some other guys that are kind of defining their
roles, the Volkus kid, he's coming in and going to be a good player.  
I think when you talk about guys that fit what we are doing, I think a guy
like Stefhon. First and foremost, the guy has won where ever he has been. He
won at Chipola Junior College. Quite naturally coming from junior college, you
hope a guy like him can come in and give you something, give you more of an
impact than let's say a freshman.  
Guys like Keon and J.T., I think they are starting to find their way. As they
find their way, they will help our basketball team. There are some pieces
there as well as some guys that are there, that are already there. I think
some of the guys right now I think are really picking up on some things. Two
of them are here today.  
I think Jason will be a different player than he has been in the past. He
don't have to do everything now. He don't have to just -- because of how we
play, that ball is going to be up the floor real quick. You will see him doing
some other things in terms of scoring.  
I think a guy like Matt Lawrence. I think Matt has tremendous basketball savvy
and he can shoot the basketball. But I think he understands the game and I
think the up-tempo would benefit a guy like Matt. You already talked about
Marshall.  
Kalen Grimes, I think he is in the best shape he has possibly been in. He has
improved probably more than any guy since I've been there, from day one to
where we are right now. I think Kalen Grimes has really improved. We will see.
As we get closer to playing other people than ourselves, sometimes you can get
-- you don't really see your basketball team because you are going against
each other. We will get a chance to see somebody other than ourselves on
November 3rd in an exhibition game, and then the real season opens on November
10th.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, welcome to the league and good luck._  
COACH ANDERSON: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: At this time we are ready to start with Nebraska. Coach Yori has
joined us on the podium. She will make a couple of opening comments and then
we will take a question or two._  
COACH YORI: Good afternoon. I think every coach comes up here and talks about
how excited they are to get started and I, too, am in the same position.  
I would say, though, that over the course of my first few years at Nebraska I
didn't feel as excited as I do today being in this position. I feel like we
finally have -- we are at a point in our program where we can compete at a
very high level against some of the better programs in this league, and we are
past the building process. And we really feel like we are into the growth
process, the growth phase of our program, and we have enough talent in our
program at this point and enough depth, knock on wood, if we stay healthy to
compete at a very high level.  
_PETER IRWIN: With that, we will take questions from the floor._  
  
Q. I wonder if you can sort of expand on that. You guys have run into some
bad luck, injuries, just different things that have happened at times in the
season where you needed the run and it didn't happen. Do you feel like that's
-- you are in a much better position this year than when it comes to February
you will not run into that?  
COACH YORI: Well, injuries are a factor in determining the outcome of your
season and that's just -- that's a fact. The years that I have coached where I
have had my best teams are years where we have stayed reasonably healthy, and
in the years that we have met our expectations or exceeded those, we have
stayed reasonably healthy.  
We have had a series of injuries in our program over the last few years that
have impacted our season negatively and every coach faces that. And that's
part of the game. Injuries are part of the game. Illness is part of the game.  
Particularly last year, we had a number of things that factored into the way
we played at various stages of the year. By no means is that an excuse, it is
just a fact. We are at this point more healthy, but still not ideally where we
would like to be. We have had some key injuries in the off-season. Danielle
Page who is one of our top three players had an ACL injury in June which is
impacting where we are right now as a program. And we have had a number of --
Kiera Hardy had her gallbladder three and a half weeks ago and has been out
all fall and just getting back. Vonnie Turner has been out all fall with a
stress fracture. We hope to get those kids back 100% quickly but we know
that's -- we are going to get back at various stages.  
  
Q. First of all, how long until Hardy is back and what about Kiera?  
COACH YORI: I will start with Kiera. Kiera began practice on Friday and that
is the first time that she has been in any basketball activity for the past --
the previous month and she will be fine. In some ways she may be sitting out
the conditioning phase of our program. In the long-term, it may benefit her
not wearing her out any more than we need to.  
In regards to Jelena Spiric, when she went down last year with an ACL at this
time of the year, last October, it was somewhat devastating for us and we knew
the importance that she brought to our program and our particular team last
year. We just didn't have anyone that could do the things that she could do
and now that she is back healthy, it is going to be. She can do so many
things. She is versatile. Two years ago when she was named Newcomer of the
Year in the Big 12, she played well, but she didn't really -- she was coming
off a different injury, another ACL, at the beginning of that season, two
seasons ago, so we really didn't see -- I don't feel like I have seen the
Jelena Spiric I know that can play at this level, not because she sat out last
year, but also two years ago she wasn't at full capacity.  
We are expecting a huge year from her and I think she is ready to make that
happen.  
  
Q. What does Jelena bring most to your team? Scoring? Passing? Rebound? What
is the one thing you missed most from her last year?  
COACH YORI: We definitely missed passing. We were the worst passing team that
I have ever coached last year. We were terrible. It is an area we were focused
on improving individually as well as a team, but also it helps to have Jelena
on the floor. She is our best ball player, our best overall passer. To get her
back in the lineup just from that standpoint will help us. Plus that is an
area we are trying to work hard on to improve.  
  
Q. Your inside game from a freshman year, just how much better will you be
this year?  
COACH YORI: Danielle Page's injury does impact us somewhat. We were expecting
Danielle to come in and be a 20-, 25-minute game player for us. She struggled
last year with health issues and played really well in the spring for us after
the season -- had dealt with the breathing issues that she -- she was
beginning to deal with the breathing issues that impacted her last year and
then her ACL set her back.  
You look at Kelsey Griffin, Chelsea Aubry will be back to her national
position. Chelsea last year played the three point for us. That was an out-
position, so moving her back to her natural position, because Jelena has
returned for us, I think is obviously going to make us stronger. Chelsea has
been a two-year starter and has a lot of experience as a senior.  
And then regarding Kelsey, I think Kelsey is a top-ten player in this league
and she is a lot better than she was a year ago. This is a kid who is the
second best freshman in the league last year, in my opinion, but she is -- she
had a tremendous freshman year despite the fact that she played with mono the
last six weeks of the season, almost the last eight weeks of the season. So
Kelsey is going to have a great year, knock on wood, if she stays healthy.  
And she is extremely determined young woman and has developed her game to the
three-point line. She is much more capable shooting the shot now than she was
a year ago. We expect her to have a good year.  
  
Q. Just what sort of -- Kiera has been an electrifying scorer. Has there
been other parts of the game that you are looking for her to be better in her
senior year?  
COACH YORI: I think one of the things that we are doing that will help Kiera
is we are playing a style that will benefit her defensively. We have not been
able to be -- to play the style really throughout my years at Nebraska that I
would like to play and that's a little bit more oriented toward the Texas A&M
style, and that is pressing, extending defense, and pressuring at half court.
We really haven't been able to do that for a number of reasons: depth. We
didn't have the athletes to do that my first few years. Like I said, a
combination of depth.  
As we go to that more and we begin to go to that later in the year, we think
that's going to play into Kiera's hands defensively, because Kiera is really
good on the ball in the full court. She can create a lot of defense -- or
offense with her defense. And I think that requires that we play very, very
hard, and I think Kiera is real excited about that.  
  
Q. Connie, can you talk about some of the young players coming in and the
depth they will bring to the guard position.  
COACH YORI: We have three freshman guards in our program. Vonnie Turner played
in the WBCA all-star game last year as a high school senior and very talented
young woman from Omaha, and a highly recruited -- one of the most highly
recruited players we have had since I have been in Nebraska. Unfortunately she
has been out with a stress fracture for eight weeks and is finally getting
back. That will set her back a little and we expected Vonnie to come in and
play quite a bit for us.  
However, she is a little bit behind because of that. But our two other
freshmen guards are playing very, very well. Nicole Neals from Phoenix has
been an extreme pleasure. We expect her to help us an enormous amount. She is
a small guard, but she is very, very talented, really good with the ball, has
bonded with what we are doing defensively and can really shoot the ball, score
the ball.  
And Kala Kuhlmann from Charter Oak, Iowa, is another player we are excited
about. An athlete that has good fundamentals.  
We think all three of those kids can help us and we are going to need them. We
will need one, two or three of them to play good ball for us.  
I think I talked about everyone except our managers. Do you want me to cover
them?  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay. We will let Coach go._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Cindy Stein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14283)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Welcome Cindy Stein from the University of Missouri._  
COACH STEIN: We are very excited to be in Oklahoma City. We think this will be
a great place for the Big 12 tournament. We feel as though our team is going
to be extremely competitive this year and we are really looking forward to it.
We have seven seniors. A lot of them have experience as returning starters. I
feel really good about our depth. Feel really good about our young kids and
obviously we are very excited. We are undefeated right now and looking forward
to a good year.  
  
Q. You were talking earlier about you have the seven seniors but you lose, I
think Latoya and Crystal were there for 40 years. How do things change without
those two, even though you have a lot of experience? Are roles going to change
a little bit for you this year?  
COACH STEIN: I think the dynamics of some of the things we did, obviously with
Latoya Bond being able to do a lot off the dribble, we set a lot of on-balls
for a more high-low-type things with Crystal and Latoya. Obviously, the
dynamics of that change as far as we probably won't have that kind of
capabilities at point guard, but we have a lot of scoring in Tiffany Brooks as
an option, Kassie Drew, Crystal Howard, some kids that are playing off guard
that we are going to be able to utilize.  
I think our point guard position is probably one of those we are not really
sure who is going to win that spot. We have got a freshmen that's come in
doing a great job and we have two seniors that have been backup point guards.
I think the dynamics of that is going to be a little bit different. I think
you will see Eetisha Riddle who played on the perimeter for us, her most
natural position is inside. And we are going to move her inside.  
  
Q. Two different things. First of all, just building off of last year and
first round exit, what did that leave your team with? What do they want to do?
Second, if you can talk about Carlynn Savant and how she has come about being
a senior in career?  
COACH STEIN: Our players have returned with a lot of motivation. I think we
were excited about the type of year we had but not so excited about how it
ended. Our last two games are games that I think live in our memory as far as
our Oklahoma game at the Big 12 and then our NCAA game with Virginia tech.
That left some bitterness in our mouth. We want to make sure we return to NCAA
tournament and that we are obviously advancing and playing a lot better, being
a lot more competitive. We kind of faded towards the end of the year there. I
think a lot of that has to do with Carlynn Savant. I think she is a great
leader. She is playing extremely well. She is one of the best three-point
shooters in the country. The things we have seen out of Carlynn this year is
kind of more of a mid-range jumper. She's has taken it to the basket a little
bit more and doing some different things and advancing her game to a whole
other level.  
  
Q. Cindy, I know coaches are all about matchups. What do you do with
Oklahoma, they got probably the toughest matchup in the country in Courtney.
What do coaches do?  
COACH STEIN: See, I thought you were talking about matchups what I was going
to wear compared to Sherri. I was a little confused. I would say that Courtney
Paris presents a problem with every team - not just Missouri, every team
because she has got great feet, great hands and great size. And so I think
that the key with Courtney is obviously try not to even let her touch the
ball. Once she touches the ball, she will be extremely hard to stop. I think
you got to put a lot of pressure and a lot of different areas.  
One of the things I have learned being in the Big 12 is the fact that you may
have Game Plan A on how to stop something, but the coaches are so good, you
better have a B, C, D, because you are going to have to keep making different
adjustments. So I don't think that you can just go in there with a certain
game plan. You are going to go with your game plan as long as that is working.  
But Coach Coale is a great coach. She is a great X-and-O coach. I am sure they
will work on everything that they can.  
The great thing about Oklahoma is not just Paris, it is the other Paris and
then it is the Russian. There is a lot of great players there.  
  
Q. Along that same line, does it feel like -- is it tough for opposing
coaches to look at it -- a team that went 19-0 last season in the Big 12 and
then has the Big 12 tournament right there in their backyard in Oklahoma
City?  
COACH STEIN: I think it is exciting. I don't really look at it as something
that's intimidating at all. I think it is exciting. I think Oklahoma is a
great team and obviously they have the potential to be in the Final 4. I think
that those are all extremely positive. I think the more our environment,
surrounding our tournament, has a lot of energy involved, I think those are
all positives. I don't think it can ever be a negative. If you are a good team
it doesn't matter where you will play.  
  
Q. Coach, which of the new players do you think might make the biggest
impact?  
COACH STEIN: Right now I would tell you that we have a freshman out of
Fayette, Missouri, Jessra Johnson. She is not the fastest thing, she doesn't
jump the highest. She gets the job done. She is always around the ball. She is
always on the floor. She gets a lot of deflections. She is doing some good
things because of our work ethic. She scores extremely well. Finds a way to
score. She looks very good right now.  
I will tell you that our point guard out of Detroit, Toy Richbow is looking
very good. She does remind a lot of people that watch us of the Latoya Bond on
the way she holds herself and the way she brings the ball down the floor and
obviously her defense is very good. I think all of our freshmen look good and
very solid.  
Crystal Howard is another player that plays a lot like Tiffany Brooks. She can
play point guard or any of the perimeter spots. Those three probably in
particular stand out.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, they let you off easy. Have a great season._  
COACH STEIN: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: It is time for Kansas State University. We would like to welcome
Deb Patterson. Coach, if would you like to make an opening comments._  
COACH PATTERSON: We are very excited about the opportunity this year to bring
a returning team from an NIT national championship to the floor. We have added
two young players in Ashley Sweat and Kari Kincaid into our program that will
impact us relatively early in their careers. And I think that with one of the
best point guards in the game here in the Big 12 in Shalee Lehning, our
returning freshmen league player, Marlies Gipson, and the return of Shana
Wheeler in the post, we have the potential to compete well and hard. And I am
excited about that, and really the energy and enthusiasm that our young team
is bringing to the floor.  
  
Q. I asked Clair this earlier about you guys and the men's program. You guys
have been front and center, center stage for a long time there now. Talk about
Coach Huggins, your relationship with him and how they have really grabbed a
lot of attention in the town.  
COACH PATTERSON: There is just a huge level of excitement about basketball in
general because of the addition of Bob Huggins to Kansas State and him
assuming the leadership position there. I think it is all tremendous. The
arena is almost sold out for the men's game. We feel very solid and secure in
the following we have at Kansas State. I think when you bring someone in to
your gym and into your arena that is one of the top ten winning coaches in
men's basketball history in terms of active coaches, it is bound to generate a
great deal of excitement.  
And I think the more positive things that we bring to Manhattan and to that
arena and to our fan base, the better it is for all of us.  
I think Bob Huggins has given Kansas State national attention and exposure,
just because of the quality of achievement that he has behind him so to me it
is all a great positive, I hope that we'll continue to generate a great deal
of enthusiasm.  
I think the demographics sometimes are a little distinct. By and large, we are
very excited just about people talking about basketball at Kansas State and as
you know, we sold out our championship game for the WNIT. It is great to see
that the men are close to selling out. A big, big change in their season
tickets.  
So for us, it is all good.  
  
Q. Deb, how do you play without a true center and what's Wheeler's physical
status right now?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think in the first five days of practice, it looks like
Shana is as strong and as aggressive as really I have ever seen her in the
gym, and that's a great encourager for all of us. I think the time away and
the time that she spent having to be really mentally and physically tough in
rehab has elevated her level of intensity. And I think she sees the window of
opportunity has closed in on her now that she didn't get that year back.  
I feel as though early -- as we are making early evaluations that Shana can
step into the five position for us and be a presence. I think we are going to
see a higher level of offensive production from her than we have seen in the
past as well because she's already showing us her shot-blocking ability and
her athleticism.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys only have ten players on your roster. Has that presented
any problems practicing or made you have to change the way you do things at
all?  
COACH PATTERSON: It hasn't been an issue to us because of the positive of
having male practice players. That's a big, big positive in the women's game,
not only if you have 12 or 13 on your roster, but certainly in a situation
like ours where there is ten because we can continue to operate and to compete
well against quicker, stronger, bigger, faster, you name it.  
I think when it might come into play some is when you have a player that gets
nicked up and gets injured and maybe your intention was to go five-on-five and
now you are five and four and you have to throw a guy in.  
By and large, as long as we are healthy, I think there is plenty of ways for
us to compensate or to adapt to having ten.  
We have seen great programs like Duke, for instance, that have competed at the
Final 4 and Elite 8 level with as many as nine on their roster. I think it is
all in the approach you take. Certainly having the male practice players is
very, very advantageous.  
  
Q. Deb, Shalee Lehning had such a great freshmen year. Can you talk about
the aspects of her game she has been able to improve for this season?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think what Shalee brought to the floor for us was great
floor leadership, kind of command of everything it is we wanted to do and just
as a great play maker.  
Unfortunately, she was injured most of the year and basically from March
through September, she was literally out of commission. So she has not really
had an opportunity to expand upon or to work on her individual skills and her
individual game. So I think that's a summer away from her in terms of just
growing individually.  
I think what carries her through is her competitiveness, her absolute full-out
intensity or intelligence that she brings to the floor as a basketball player.  
I think we will see her improve a great deal with respect to her understanding
defensively. That's certainly an area where I think we'll see growth in her
just because of the transfer that you make from your freshman to sophomore
year. I think we will see that in Marlies and Zanotti.  
We know the area of game we want to grow the most for Shalee Lehning is her
ability to be an effective scorer from the perimeter in all situations. So I
think that will evolve through the season. But I think it will evolve only
through a lot of hard work during the season because she didn't have that
opportunity in the off season because of injury.  
  
Q. Deb, can you talk about what Clair Coggins means to this team as a
veteran and what you expect from her.  
COACH PATTERSON: I am so excited right now about the kind of season that I see
ahead for Claire Coggins. I think the last month or month and a half of her
junior year, she played absolutely astounding basketball. She was at a very
high caliber as a rebounder, as a defender, and as a scorer, and reached a
level of consistency that I think the great ones attain.  
As she heads into her senior year, we will look to her for stability out there
on the basketball floor, consistency. And those are elements that I think had
developed in her game over time, but that she really brought to the table that
last month and a half. And I'm excited as we started these first five days of
practice to see that in the gym every day now from her as a senior. I think
she is far and away one of the most talented guards in this league. I think
before it is all said and done, she will be a first-team all-Big 12 player. I
think she has the potential and the capabilities if she continues to work hard
of playing at the next level and being the next Kansas State player to do
that.  
I am very excited about her versatility, the strength and I think the maturity
and consistency that I am seeing from her right now. I really think she will
be a premiere player all season long.  
  
Q. How do you assess Kimberly's play and where do you see her improving?  
COACH PATTERSON: It is interesting because Kimberly is sort of the quiet
contributor who is -- last year for our basketball team, who about January
began to emerge very, very consistent in her scoring. By the time the season
ended for us, she was by far our best perimeter defender. When we had to make
stops on individual talent, we assigned Kimberly Dietz to that player and had
great success.  
Offensively, she is very, very adept at both shooting the three and at getting
to the rim. In fact, I think she -- it is as toss-up between she and Claire
Coggins which brings the greater ability to both of those roles on the floor
right now.  
Who is going to be the better three-point shooter tonight? Who is going to be
the better penetrator? I think they are a great one-two back court
combination. Kimberly brings great strength. Last year I thought as the season
transpired she gained a greater level of confidence playing both the point
position and the two for us when we needed it.  
So as we head into this season, I see Kimberly being a very critical element,
a very solid starter, someone that comes off of WNIT tournament scoring 20
points a game. She is a high-caliber, high-level talent and she has gained a
great deal of confidence and a good feel for how we like to play now.  
So I expect great things from her and the thing that's also true of Kimberly
is like most great shooters, if she is struggling a little bit early in the
game, she won't necessarily pull back and lose her confidence and stop
shooting. So we are going to need that kind of production from her, especially
if we are not getting it out of the point position and I think she is more
than capable. So I am very excited about where she is at right now.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, I think they are ready for lunch. Thank you very much.
Wish you the best of the luck for the season._  
COACH PATTERSON: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We are now ready for Baylor University. Coach would you like to
make an opening comment or two?_  
COACH MULKEY: Not really  
_PETER IRWIN: You want to start with questions. That will work with me. We
will get the mic people in place. We have a question on the front left._  
  
Q. Everybody has been talking a lot about Bernice. Can you tell us a little
bit about her game and what she will bring to you guys.  
COACH MULKEY: Bernice Mosby obviously sat out last year, she transferred to us
from Florida and Bernice was -- I don't know, you could go back and look at
all the accolades she received when she came out of high school, going to
Florida. She was, I think, SEC, all-freshmen team when she was there. She will
only have one year in our program and it is at a much-needed time after we
lost Sophia Young. Bernice plays very similar to Sophia in that she can play
facing the basket and she can play with her back to the basket. Bernice will
be a senior captain for us this year and sure am glad we have her.  
_PETER IRWIN: Got a question. We will take Tom first and then we will move
across._  
  
Q. Has the conference started with the season with as much of a stand as
Oklahoma seems to be this year --  
COACH MULKEY: I think we ought to just cancel it. Just cancel the whole
season, huh? Is that your point?  
  
Q. I am asking, are they casting a bigger shadow than what the favorites
have in other years?  
COACH MULKEY: Oklahoma is the team to beat. Oklahoma has every weapons they
need to win a national championship and the rest of us are just trying to have
a good night when we play them to stay in the ball game  
_PETER IRWIN: We will take Michelle, next._  
  
Q. You talked about how Bernice came at a good time. Can you talk about the
development of your young post players because -- right now seem like guards
are maybe more the given in your program a little bit, how do you feel like a
young post player are going to develop?  
COACH MULKEY: They are going to develop, Michelle, because they have to play.
We have Rachel Allison who got significant minutes as a freshman last year. We
will just bring a lot of teaching to the two freshmen or the other three
freshmen post players in Danielle Wilson and Kaitlin Oberg and Jessika
Bradley. Those five, of course, Bernice, too, will be our post players and you
are looking at three freshmen, a sophomore and a senior. Bernice and Rachel
with the most experience will be the ones that those freshmen follow.  
On the perimeter, you will have Angela Tisdale who really is our most
experienced player based upon the time she spent in our program to give you
some idea of just how young we are, not only do we have the six high school
kids or the freshmen, you have three sophomores, you have got one junior and
you have got two seniors. When I say seniors, don't think that those kids have
been in our program for four years. Those seniors, one has been with me two-
years and one has been with me, this is her third year. So they are really not
your true seniors that you recruited out of high school.  
So we really are a bunch of babies out there that are just going to have to
grow and get better and mature and they will. They are very talented. Don't
let me come up here and mislead you, they are very talented. At this level,
you got to have some experience and that's what we don't have.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the right-hand side._  
  
Q. Coach, you said Oklahoma has every weapons they need to win a national
championship. Talk about some of the intangibles that you noticed the year you
guys won the national championship. What had to happen?  
COACH MULKEY: A lot of things. One, you have to stay away from injuries. You
have to have unbelievable team chemistry, you have to have great role-players
that accept their role and then along the way a little bit of luck. Beat
somebody in a situation that maybe you are not supposed to beat or you are not
playing well or you can overcome a difficult time in the game. So a lot of
things do have to take place. If it was just based on talent alone, I think
all of us would agree the most talented teams don't always win the national
championships in every sport, but it is going to take more than just talent,
you are absolutely right.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the left-hand side and then we will go to
the back._  
  
Q. The three players you lost were very important to your team the last few
years. Will this team look different without those three and can you be more
guard-oriented?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think we are going to be more guard-oriented. I really
don't. I think if you watch us play, you are going to see probably a lot of
our scoring come from the post again. It may be such that Bernice scores a lot
facing the basket, depending on the development of the post freshmen player,
if I can use her as a three player or not. You will see a very similar team. I
don't think there is -- Sophia Young will just be head and shoulders above
everybody else. But I think you will see a mixture of kids that on one night
may score ten and the next night it may be somebody else scoring ten. You are
not going to have the superstar player. You will have a very good player in
Bernice Young -- I mean, in Bernice Mosby, but I will not make her become
Sophia Young. Bernice has her own style of play and Bernice will bring a
valuable scoring threat to our team this year - again, at a time where we
really need it.  
_PETER IRWIN: We will take a question all the way on the rear flat form._  
  
Q. Coach, you told us last week that Oklahoma is obviously the favorite, as
you told us here, and that you like challenges. Do you think this year, not
only with Oklahoma up top, but with Texas A &M, Gary Blair resurgence, and you
right there in the mix, that this is a team that's prime for a good challenge
and your youth and making their own legacy?   
COACH MULKEY: Challenge is what we do every day. The challenge for this
basketball team will be how quickly can we get better. Sometimes, you want it
to be just a little bit faster than they are capable. Sometimes it is faster
than you thought. The challenge for us in the schedule we have in
nonconferences, we have to try to do it as quickly as we can. We can't wait
until conference to get better. Every day we have got to get better. The thing
I have noticed about this particular basketball team is their knowledge of the
game is very good. I am not having to repeat myself as much as I thought I
would. Correct mistakes, move on and next time you have an opportunity to do
it, they are showing me that they listened to me the first time that I told
them and that's a sign of being able to move at a fast pace.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the front left._  
  
Q. Two questions. First, usually -- it is usually two years, three years
after a national championship you can start to see the impact of recruiting
because of the exposure. I wonder if you could talk about how that's affected
Baylor, just the places you can go now or that sort of impact.  
Second, obviously, you have known Gary Blair for over two decades. Can you
talk about what he has done at Texas A&M and how that team sort of reflects
the way he coaches.  
COACH MULKEY: We saw the impact of our national championship in recruiting in
that immediate next year's recruiting class. Our freshmen this year, if you
believe in poles and if you take and if you take all that to heart, was ranked
as number one in the country. We saw it immediately, Michelle, and we are
continuing to see it  
Gary Blair was an assistant coach at Louisiana Tech when I was a player. He is
a workaholic. Sometimes, I like to pick on Coach Blair. It reminds me of Dale
Brown that used to coach at LSU, give them a microphone and they don't know
when to hush.  
Sometimes Coach Blair gets so into what he does, it is like, okay, you have
said enough Coach, you are going to out-recruit her. You got her coming to A &
M so hush or she will go somewhere else. He is a workaholic. I knew when they
hired him that that program would make significant strides and be turned
around and it has.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the rear right-hand side._  
  
Q. Kim, for the first time you have been here you have had a couple changes
on the coaching staff. Everyone is talking about the newcomers on the team.
You have a lot of new faces to help you coach.  
COACH MULKEY: That's rare in this profession. Coaches come and go. I had three
coaches when I took over at Baylor that stayed with me six years. I now have
Karen Aston who I hired to replace Ken Brock. Karen came to us from the
University of Texas. She is an unbelievable basketball coach. The best part of
her coaching is her ability to recruit. She works nonstop at recruiting. She
will be in charge of post players. A lot of what I teach to our freshmen post
players I am also teaching to Karen.  
Or our new coach Damion McKinney is another young man that has ties to the AAU
scene in the Dallas area. He is a Waco native so he is coming back home. And
those two guys are learning just as the freshmen are. And I hope, as you do
with everything you teach as a head coach, to be able to in a year or two to
have taught them the way you want them to teach the post players, and I won't
have to do as much work, but when you have a change in staff, it kind of makes
you as the head coach go back and start doing the teaching yourself until they
have learned and become comfortable with your system.  
_PETER IRWIN: Got a question on the rear._  
  
Q. OU went 19-0 in the league last year. What are your thoughts on them
getting now the Big 12 tournament in their own backyard?  
COACH MULKEY: What do I think about them getting it?  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on -- obviously it just adds to -- obviously they
are a very good team and they get the Big 12 tournament in their own backyard.
What are your thoughts on that whole thing?  
COACH MULKEY: I think what great advantage. It would be like hosting it in
Waco. If the people in Oklahoma have not seen those guys play, they need to
make the effort to go see them play. They are very good. Oklahoma City is
going to enjoy this tournament, they are going to obviously enjoy having a
University from their home state be here to draw fans. I would just encourage
them to see them play and looking forward to coming here, I have never been to
Oklahoma City other than recruiting. But to play or even be a part or see the
arena, so we are excited about coming.  
_PETER IRWIN: Another question for the Coach? Coach, they were easy on you. We
have a question in the back._  
  
Q. Kim, obviously you have been there where you have built a program up,
what are your thoughts on OSU and the job that Kurt Budkey has in front of him
for that program?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes. When I took over at Baylor, the prior team had won seven
games and I think that, as I said after we won the national championship, what
we did at Baylor in five years gives hope to every program across the country
that it can be done. If you have the right administration, if you have the
right resources, it can be done, I think that without me even having to say a
whole lot, just the fact that we won it in five years and to take that program
from where it was to where it is today, just speaks to coaches across the
country. And that's probably the message I would give to Kurt. Look at what we
have done. It can be done anywhere  
_PETER IRWIN: On the front, Tom._  
  
Q. Kim, you mentioned Bernice. What does she do well? How is she going to
contribute? .  
COACH MULKEY: Bernice is a 6' 1", I don't know if you want to call her a post
player. She is a 6' 1" athlete that can face the basketball, take you off the
dribble. She can play with her back to the basket. She is physical for her
size. She is experienced having played in the S.E.C. for three years. She has
got a little bit -- I don't mean this in any kind of negative way, but she has
got a little nastiness to her game that maybe Sophia Young didn't have. Sophia
was a very pleasant type of competitor. Bernice takes it personal. And I think
we need that. We need her to teach our younger post players how hard you have
to play on every play, how hard you have to practice and how intense you have
to be, Bernice does that for us, Bernice learned that a little bit from Sophia
on the intensity level, but her personality is a lot more -- just takes the
competitiveness a little more personal.  
_PETER IRWIN: This will be the final question from the floor._  
  
Q. Kim, a followup about Karen. It is rare for any assistant coach to
generate headlines about when they change jobs, but Karen leaving Texas and
going to another Big 12 school was a gigantic coup for you obviously. Have you
noticed that on the recruiting trail already, you have one of the best
recruiters in the league now on your staff?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, I have noticed it. That's not to take anything away from
Coach Brock, Jennifer and Johnny who were on my staff. We worked extremely
hard and let me back up, Brian, before I talk about Karen.  
Sometimes you can be a great recruiter and don't have to do anything, the
school recruits itself. And I think Karen would be the first to tell you at
the University of Texas that school recruits itself in all sports. And she
gives credit just like that, but what Karen does that makes her so special is
that this is her life. She has a dog she goes home to, but this is her life.
She loves communicating with young people. She is constantly on all this stuff
-- all this mechanical stuff that -- the guy asked me if I had an iPod. I said
I don't even own an iPod. I said that's what Karen does. She enjoys that. She
has a relationship with these players. She has been around some of the legends
of the game. She got her start in coaching at Baylor University so she was
connected to Baylor. Sonja Hogue hired her out of high school. She went to
north Texas and has been with Coach Conrad at the University of Texas. She has
been around legends of the game to learn. I just -- she reenergized my battery
and I know that the national championship has now opened doors for us and to
have Karen come and get in those doors and be able to get recruits for us is
just going to pay dividends for our program.  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay. Coach, thank you very much._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: It is now time for the Buffalos from Colorado University and
Kathy McConnell-Miller. Welcome, Coach, and if you will make a comment or
two._  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: It is exciting for me to be back in the state of
Oklahoma, having spent six years at the University of Tulsa. It is always
great to get back. Very excited that the tournament is being hosted here.  
I am definitely excited about this upcoming season, coming off last year
definitely not what any coach would want, but a real learning experience for
myself and my team.  
We have Jackie McFarland with us today. She is coming off a great year, had a
great summer with us and preseason practices are going well. And I just think
it is an exciting time for us. We definitely have a ways to go, but we are
definitely making strides.  
It just feels good to have one year under my belt at the University of
Colorado and in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Kathy, just talking about having Kara back and how that impacts
everything with her on the court and letting Jackie go back to the four
spot?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: At this point we were preparing with Kara. She is a
great force in the paint. She has great size. She has great ability and really
has a desire to be a great player. The off-season, the red shirt year for her
with a fracture in the foot was a great year for her. She was out for a very
short time, and I would say mid January was back in practice full.  
So you think about being without her for a year, but we definitely had her in
practice and had exposure to what her strengths were, where she needed to get
better. And she was exposed to our season and what we are trying to
accomplish. It is always a lot easier to sit back and watch and really help
and figure out if I was out there, what would I do.  
She has come back. She is injury-free. She is in great shape. She is stronger.
She is quicker. And her desire is even more -- is even stronger to compete in
the Big 12 and be a force as a center in the Big 12.  
The ability to move Jackie McFarland to the four spot, Jackie is the type of
player that really likes the ball in her hands. It will allow her to face-up a
little bit more. She will draw the smaller defenders and it is going to give
Jackie a little more freedom. She was really taxed last year in so many ways.
We required so much of her in the scoring, rebounding, minutes played. Told
her not to foul. Don't get in any foul trouble, Jackie. Yet, I needed her to
stop Courtney Paris or anyone that we asked her to stop.  
To watch the two of them side by side has been really refreshing. When they go
against each other, it is a great matchup, but we've really worked a lot with
the two of them in the off-season and they are just a great combination. They
are great friends on and off the floor.  
  
Q. My question was actually about Kara as well. I guess, being gone and
seeing things benefit you especially since she had a pretty good freshman
year, but she probably needed to grow up some. Can that help her?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think she has matured so much off the floor and has
become a leader for us. I do think it is hard, though, sometimes to get back
into the swing of things. I think if anything is missing right now, it might
and little bit of her timing as far as our offensive sets and where she needs
to be.  
But that year off watching her on the bench, we took her on some road trips
and to have her in practice, she was everybody's center, from Iowa State to
Baylor. So she definitely matured in the off-year.  
I can only imagine her as a fifth-year senior. Very much looking forward to
getting her on the floor and competing. Again, she is just so much stronger
than she was last year. The one thing that I found interesting last year was
that she used to fall a lot. I was never really quite sure why she did that.
But then we realized she probably wasn't as strong as she needed to be and she
spent the entire season in the -- in the off-season in the weight room.
Everybody else is going two times. She is going three and four, really
building up her body.  
We haven't seen Kara get hit with the pads or get hit with anybody and go to
the floor. She is definitely stronger. She has extended her range to about 15
feet and she is definitely more confident. And I think just the relationship
that she has with Jackie off the floor, you can really see it on the floor
now.  
  
Q. Kathy, you have talked about the inside game. You have got a lot of youth
in your guard play. Talk about how they have developed so far, what you have
seen here early in the season.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: At least we have some guards. That's a good thing.
There is no doubt that our strength is in our front line with Jasmina Ilic,
Jackie McFarland, and Kara Richards. They are experienced. They are very
dedicated, very focused and three of our best leaders at this point.  
But I feel very blessed with some transfers and some incoming freshmen that we
do have some options at the guard spot.  
Bianca Smith right now I would say is probably playing the best of anybody.
Just has an incredible jump shot, great range, and just has a lot of ability.
She can play the point. She can play the two. She really prefers to play the
two because she thinks she can shoot more at the two. But she really can play
both positions, great leader.  
With the incoming freshman in the transfers, practices have become so
competitive to the point where sometimes we have to stop drills. It's exciting
to see, but as a coach, you really feel good when you have some options and
you know that you are really -- your hands aren't tied. You are not strapped
to do some things. We will be able to experiment. We will be able to do a lot
more of what we like to do.  
Susie Powers, the transfer from Notre Dame, she will see some time at the
point guard, the off guard. But I would say our three, four and five are
definitely -- I would say pretty much locked up.  
But our guards, it is really up in the air and practices are competitive
because they know there are a lot of minutes to be played.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just your guard play, how you feel that's come
together. I know that's obviously an area of personal expertise for you, how
do you feel you will do this year?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I have got three players that could potentially play
the point guard position. Bianca Smith, Susie Powers and Whitney Houston, and
none of which have played it ever for me or within the last two years in
college. So it's definitely -- it is going to be a learning curve. And we
start tomorrow with our point guard meetings in the office to really talk
about our sets. There is a lot of times in practice where Jackie has got the
hot hand or you need Kara on the block, and some of the decision-making really
needs to improve. Their ability -- they definitely have the ability, but to be
a point guard I think takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of studying
the game.  
There has just been some situations where we look really good and then there
are some days that we know we have got a ways to go. But there is no doubt
that there will be a newcomer or freshman that's going to be controlling the
ball for the majority of the year for us. So there is just a lot of learning
to do.  
I would say size-wise we are probably bigger than we were last year. We are
definitely quicker. It is going to allow us on the defensive end to really do
some different things. And I would say with Jasmina and Kara back and
depending what we do with the guard, it will really lighten Jackie's load. She
is not going to have to endure the scoring load she has endured in the past.
Although she will probably get the touches that she needs. There is no doubt
the strength is inside and we continuously get better at the guard spot.  
  
Q. Kathy, ten of your losses last year were by ten points or less. Talk
about what your team takes away from that and what they can use to build on
that this year.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think the lack of depth was key in that there were
times that I had to really plead with Jackie and say, You know what? Maybe you
can take off practice tomorrow if you just finish the game for us.  
We really didn't have a lot of depth when it was -- there were times we looked
at each other and just basically said, You are going to have to finish this
game. You are going to have to kick it out.  
And there were so many games that we were in it up until four minutes, the
four-minute media timeout in the second half. And teams just kept coming at us
with stronger, with fresh legs and that's very difficult to deal with.  
When Jackie is dealing with double coverage, triple coverage and we have
nobody to kick out to, to hit a shot, that becomes just very taxing and I
think they take away from it.  
Hey, we were in games, but they know we didn't win them. And we are just not a
team that believes in moral victories. We felt good about what we did last
year, but know that Colorado has got a ways to go to be able to compete night
in and night out.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, they let you off easy. Best of luck to you. Have a great
season._  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Thanks.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach Henrickson has joined us at the podium and we would like
to welcome you and your team and wish you best of luck for the season._  
COACH HENRICKSON: Good morning, good to see everybody. Just briefly here. A
little bit about where we are. Seven returning, seven freshmen. Jody Conradt
told me this last thing at the conference meetings, You have been through a
season with seven freshmen, is there any advice you might give me, and she
looked at me and said, Get out your cell phone, call three of them right now
and tell them they can't come. I think it might be too late for that, Jodi.
But I will say that I am glad I didn't do that. I am excited about all seven.
They have been very low maintenance, they have exceeded my expectations for
intensity and basketball IQ and competitiveness and I have got a couple that
have emerged as leaders already. I am excited about that and I have respected
our seven returning players for how patient, how -- what good role models they
have been for those seven kids and excited about the chemistry, about the
energy in practice every day and just feel like it will be very different,
much different defensively and much better defensively, I will say.  
Also we have a lot of questions that need to be answered, and I don't have a
lot of answers until we will practice some more. The question I can answer is,
Am I excited about them? Absolutely. Have we made improvements? Absolutely.
Just got to figure some things out. Who wants to have the ball? They want it.
And we need to develop consistency in the post as well. I will open it up from
there.  
_PETER IRWIN: We will take questions for Coach._  
  
Q. Coach, who do you foresee picking up the scoring slack after losing your
top three scorers? Any particular individuals?  
COACH HENRICKSON: It will be by committee, so individuals -- when you said
plural, that's exactly right. There isn't one player. We have got Marija
Zinic, the post player will get more touches on the end of the year, played
awfully consistent, played down the stretch in the last six or eight games. We
have by committee as far as how we are going to score, I think I can answer
how we are going to score, I think, and make up that versus who would do that.  
I think defensively we will create opportunities in transition. There is
absolutely no reason for us to be last in defensive field goal percentage. We
should defend, force tougher shots, rebound and run. Our opportunity in
transition I think is we will make up some of those points.  
For us to get on the offensive glass, guards going to the boards, we are
bigger, more athletic. They have proven they are capable of doing that in
practice. Offensive rebounding, we will get to the free throw line because we
will put it to the floor more than we have the first two years, we have more
play makers. Kids can get in there or make a play or pass, a pass to a
teammate or make a play to the rim. Those three areas is how we will score
differently than we have in my first two years.  
_PETER IRWIN: Got a question on the front left._  
  
Q. Along with having all those new players, you have a fairly early start
for the season.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Yeah, beautiful time, don't you think?  
  
Q. How far along will the team need to be to be gelling at the start of the
season. How much of a building process will this be in the early stages for
your team?  
COACH HENRICKSON: What's good for us, all seven of those freshmen were on
campus this summer. Some of them were on summer session as far as the
returners. As far as playing pickup and getting familiar with each other, they
are farther along than I thought. They have a decent sense.  
Now, offensively we just have a couple things in here recently. But it is what
it is. And it might be more of an issue for us because we are young, but we
will continue to get better. Every day we understand each other better once we
understand the system and have more structure than they had this summer in
pickup.  
Defensively -- I understood offensively with young kids that's the hardest
transition to make. Defensively we can teach defense early and often and we
did. Last year I made the mistake and spent a lot of time on offense because I
was mortified after my first year because we couldn't score. Then I was
mortified in my second year we couldn't defend. Our offense will come. Again,
I have players that will be more aggressive and get to the rim and pull up and
take a shot. Young kids that are doing that right now which is exciting.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the right-hand side. Blair, just a
moment._  
  
Q. Bonnie, what did the NIT mean for your team last year?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Step in the right direction for us. Post-season exposure for
the returning players, it is good to have conversation about building on that
and taking the next step and understanding what it's like to play in post-
season; what it is like for the phone to ring and that you get that
opportunity and the excitement that involves that contest and the excitement
again to create that in Lawrence. We had a great run to start the year last
year and create a lot of energy. We dropped the ball and didn't -- weren't
consistent with that throughout the conference season, and at least had a
second chance, so to speak, in post-season.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the right-hand side behind the cameraman._  
  
Q. Bonnie, talk a little bit about your success at home last year and I
guess how you all would like to carry that over and maybe have a little more
success on the road.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Excuse me?  
  
Q. Success at home last year.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right. We certainly handled our nonconference season well
and did a very good job there. And I was talking to someone yesterday, the
best thing about that, it created a lot of excitement every time someone read
in the paper we were undefeated. Most people don't care who you play. To hear
the women's team was undefeated created a lot of excitement. We go on the road
in Nebraska and Colorado, play well in Nebraska and don't play well in
Colorado, and it started to snowball for us.  
That's where we have to develop mental toughness. I think we have that. That's
why this league is so good and so difficult to win on the road because the
environment on the road. But for us to create energy and have excitement at
home as much as Lou Perkins let's me play at home, it is important to be
successful at home.  
_PETER IRWIN: Have a question on the right-hand side._  
  
Q. Bonnie, can you talk about what Taylor needs to do this season, what her
expectations are?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Taylor needs to go back to her freshman year. Taylor had a
very, very good freshman year. For whatever reason she hit that sophomore
slump. But I see the freshman Taylor McIntosh, and most people say, Well, good
heavens, why would you want her to be a freshman? She flew around. She kept
her feet alive and kept the floor alive and we didn't get that consistently
from here.  
I am not saying anything publicly that Taylor and I didn't talk about last
year. She recognizes she is a bright kid. She works hard. She wants to be a
good player. She has worked in the summer on her high-post jumper, that's a
lot better than it has been since she came to Lawrence.  
And that was important for her to give us something, whether it is a catch-
and-shoot or a rip-through to the rim and she has worked on that. She made
that commitment this past summer and she didn't make the commitment this
summer. And she recognized that and it did affect her sophomore year.  
For her to fly around and have the energy her freshman year, what's different
now, Taylor McIntosh her freshman year didn't have leadership ability. She
wasn't confident enough and didn't understand her role. With upper classmen,
that's understanding. But right now she's a good leader. She has mother-henned
the seven freshmen. She pulls them in, she talks to them and she is very good.
She says the right thing because she does the right thing. And when you have
seven freshmen, your upper classmen better do it right and take care of
business because the young ones are looking at them about how are we supposed
to act. If they acted like Taylor McIntosh every day, we would be happy.  
_PETER IRWIN: We had a question on the front left._  
  
Q. One more question for the freshmen. You said early on, some of them have
been leaders. Who looks like they might make the quickest impact for you?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right now on the perimeter, the most promising right now --
and that could change, probably the most pleasant surprise is LaChelda Jacobs
who is from outside of Dallas. What's been a pleasant surprise is her offense
ability. Defensively we knew she would be very good. Very talented. Has long
reach. Has active hands on the ball, creates some opportunities in transition.
But offensively she has been aggressive. She has better one-on-one skills than
I thought she would have.  
Sade has been a good leader. You start to hear her voice. She has actually
played in the last week more confidently offensively. To have Mom and Dad last
weekend on campus for Late Night, I think we might have been homesick. She has
a different pep to her step since Mom and Dad were in campus over the weekend.
Offensively and defensively she is a long linky kid and passes the ball well.  
Danielle McCray, the 5' 1" kid, she is a long linky kid as well. She had a
procedure on her shin so she has been behind a little bit from conditioning
standpoint. She is in full now but she just hasn't had the reps defensively
that those other kids have and you can telling. She will get it back. She
wants to do a great job.  
And then Kelly Kohn, little combo guard from just south of Detroit, her father
is a hall-of-fame high school football coach in Michigan. And I have said that
since the first time I met her, that this young lady will understand the game
because she has heard the talk from both sides of the whistle. Her brother was
a football player. Her sister played at Syracuse and then transferred to Ohio
University. She has had a lot of athletic experience. She has watched her
siblings and dad for years. She does get it. She is a competitive kid. She is
tough. She is not afraid to say something, Upper classmen might not be giving
great effort, I like that. We need that. We have -- half our team are
freshman. We need to teach our freshmen.  
The kids will have to step up and be accountable for themselves and grab a
couple others with them. She has been able to do that already.  
_PETER IRWIN: Question on the front right._  
  
Q. Bonnie, would you talk about the conference and the strength that it has
this year.  
COACH HENRICKSON: This year and every year. Obviously with what Sherri has got
returning at Oklahoma and then her freshmen, she has to be awfully, awfully
excited and anxious to get started. The quality and depth she has with the
five new kids and the strength she has inside and outside to build on their
success last year. At A & M, an athletic team but disciplined team, very
skilled offensive team that can use the press effectively and get up and down
and score some points but be solid defensively. You got Baylor and Texas.
Texas, I am sure, is anxious to get kids healthy. I talked to Jody not long on
the road. I don't need to talk about Jody's kids, but I am excited about those
kids being sophomores this year and Baylor has some awfully young kids,
returning kids that are talented.  
It is, from top to bottom every night, a great league every night.
Competitive. You have coaches. I tell people on the road this summer all the
time, what good coaches you have in the league. You better be able to adjust
before you ever get into the contest at half time or time out. You better be
able to make some adjustments. You better be able to adapt your style a little
bit and better be able to play for 40 minutes. These teams are prepared in
this league. They recruit great players and coach those kids. That's what
makes it a great game for fans to watch.  
_PETER IRWIN: Another question for Coach? Good luck, Coach._  
COACH HENRICKSON: They feel sorry for me.  
_PETER IRWIN: I don't think so. One more question for Coach before we break?_  
_All right. Coach, we wish you the best of luck. We have one more question --
I'm sorry. Excuse me._  
  
Q. Ivana, that is your point guard, can you talk about her role this year?
Is it going to change at all?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She has more of a leadership role as a sophomore point
guard. We need Ivana. We have had her from November to middle of December. She
hit her wall her freshman year and kept bouncing off of it most of January and
February. She made a commitment and went to Dena Evans point guard college
camp in central Missouri late this spring and I think really grasped what we
have been saying.  
Sometimes you might need to hear it from someone else and it was a great
teaching opportunity for her and a great learning experience for her, and
physically, but also intellectually, as far as really vying into what a
leadership role she has to have in that position. I hear her voice more now
and that's important. Defensively, she has made progress. We have spent the
spring and fall with her footwork. And she seems to be able to contain a
little better than she did last year and that will be important in our
defensive scheme that she has been able to contain. She has done a better job
of that.  
It is nice to have her experience. She has a very good basketball IQ. She is a
real coachable kid. For us early that will be very important.  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay. Now we will let you go, Coach. Thanks again and best of
luck for the season._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We would like to welcome Coach Fennelly to the podium at this
time from Iowa State University. Coach, if you will make opening comments and
then we will take questions._  
BILL FENNELLY: Looks like the same people in the same states every year.  
_PETER IRWIN: Michelle moved from the other side. She used to sit on the
right._  
BILL FENNELLY: Obviously, we are excited to be here. I wanted to thank the
people of Oklahoma City. I think this is going to be a great event and it is
exciting for our players and staff to think about coming to a new venue and a
new part of the country. From everyone I have seen and heard, they really
embraced this tournament and what it's about, so we are looking forward to
coming.  
Like everyone else, we are excited about starting the season. We start
practice on Saturday and so far so good.  
I think we have a team that will be better in a lot of areas, but this is a
tough league. I think it is a league that every year produces some outstanding
stories and hopefully we can be one of those stories.  
  
Q. Hi, Bill.  
BILL FENNELLY: Hi, Dan.  
  
Q. You were picked fifth. Were you surprised by that at all or is that about
what you thought?  
BILL FENNELLY: I don't know, Dan. I would say I was surprised. I felt like
ourselves, Nebraska, Kansas State, a lot of us, would be bunched in that
middle group. I think probably when you look at people who are returning and
the strength of the league near the top, I really thought -- I told my son, I
would be surprised if it was fifth or ninth, somewhere in there. And I think
if you look at the numbers, it is pretty close in there.  
I would like to finish fifth. That would be kind of cool. I think if you
finish in the upper division in this league you will be playing in March.  
Probably not surprised, but hopefully it is something our players are excited
about and we can build towards that end.  
  
Q. Bill, at least you have some depth this year, because I know last year
you had some times when you were pretty worried about that. Can you talk about
that? And also if you can talk about Rachel, just what you expect out of her,
this being her freshman year.  
BILL FENNELLY: Yeah, Michelle, the biggest concern we had about our team last
year is that we played probably four and a half players most of the year. I
thought our kids were outstanding in the way they competed and fought through
some injury issues, but we are deeper. We have 13 players out there in
practice, and I think that we have added depth in every position. I think we
are -- in a football term, we are probably too deep almost everywhere. A lot
of that is untested, but I think there is potential there.  
Rachel Pierson is someone that adds a dynamic to our team that we haven't had
in a while of a true center. We haven't played with a true center in a long
time and Rachel red-shirted last year. She had a back operation on January the
7th, and I think my concern to be honest with you was whether or not, you
know, not that she could play ever again at a high level, but function. That's
a scary thing to be 18 years old and someone is operating on your back.  
Rachel has had a great fall. I think she is someone that will add a lot to our
team, obviously hasn't played competitively in about 20 months. But she does
change our team and gives us something that we haven't had in a long time. So
hopefully that will open up some things for some other players.  
But the depth of our team is much better and having a true center adds a lot
to something we haven't had in a few years.  
  
Q. Hey, Bill.  
BILL FENNELLY: How are you doing?  
  
Q. Good. What's scary about playing Texas A &M? They are picked second in
this league and I think a lot of people don't necessarily look forward to
playing them.   
BILL FENNELLY: No, I don't think you look forward to playing them. I think
Gary is always whining about something. He is always worried about something
bad is going to happen to him. I think the thing about A & M, they play a
unique style. It is hard to prepare for that. Pressing and running. It is just
one of those things as a coach you want to go into every game and you want to
prepare and you think you have your kids ready to play.  
With A & M, you can't simulate that stuff in practice. They play with a great
amount of energy. He has brought tremendous enthusiasm to the program. You
look at what they have done with men's and women's basketball, I think that
both those programs have really done a great job and I think it creates a lot
of enthusiasm. And it is a unique situation and we only play them once.  
So you really -- the preparation is always an issue and you have to
understand, every coach panics about turning the ball over in games. You are
going to turn the ball over against A & M. You are. Do turnovers lead to easy
baskets? Last year when we played them, we didn't turn the ball over in an
inordinate amount of time, but when we did, they made layups.  
Their defense creates points. Which a lot of other teams can play good, solid
defense, but I don't know if the conversion to points is there like A & M. I
don't know if I have seen a team offense rebound like that in a long time.
They are well-coached. They have a great system. They have a system they
believe in and it has obviously created a great amount of success in a short
amount of time.  
  
Q. Alison Lacey played most of her career in Australia. She has had a year
to adjust to U.S. ball. But did you notice a certain style about her that's
different from most American players?  
BILL FENNELLY: Alison is a freshman on our team. She is from Australia. Played
one year of high school basketball in Iowa, and the one thing about Alison,
she is very skilled. She thinks the three-point line is two feet farther back
than where it is because of the international game. She likes to play the game
with a little bit of flare. A lot of things are not as fundamental as we are
used to seeing. She passes the ball with one hand. She does a lot of things
that are very creative with the ball.  
I think the thing that Alison needs to learn, like all freshmen, especially
someone like herself, is the day-to-day rigors of practice games, the way we
want to play fundamentally, things like that.  
She is a very talented kid. She is going to impact our team, no question. I
think she can score the ball, she can play a multitude of positions. But she
is a fun kid to have around.  
Obviously that's part of the collegiate experience, too. Our kids are from
Minnesota, California, you have to throw a kid in [there from|therefrom]
Australia, the social aspects, it is a great learning experience for Alison,
but also for other players. She is extremely talented and she will play a lot
for us.  
  
Q. Bill, with [] Lindsay Wilson, she did everything for you her senior year,
but the team struggled a little bit that year. Is Lindsey Medders in a
different situation this year not? They seem a lot similar to me, and a player
that can carry a tremendous amount of weight. This year, she probably has a
little more complete team around her.  
BILL FENNELLY: Lyndsey has a lot more help, there is no question. Lyndsey
Medders is really a very special player. She is a very special person. You are
talking about a kid that basically played the last two months of the season
with a broken foot and had to put a screw in her foot at the end of the year.
She has always done what we have asked her to do. I think every coach wants a
great point guard and I wouldn't -- I wouldn't trade her for anyone in the
country. I really wouldn't. She understands our system better than any guard I
have ever had. She understands the way we want to play. She has embraced what
it means to be an Iowa State player and has brought that to our fan base.  
And with her and Megan, we have probably two of the greatest -- the best
senior leaders I have ever had in the sense of what they have done for four
years, how they've been through a lot of things and never complained, whether
I changed positions on them where we didn't have the depth.  
It is always hard to lose seniors, but these two probably have done as much
for Iowa State women's basketball from start to finish as any two of I have
ever had. I hope they can enjoy their senior year the way they have deserved
to enjoy up to this point.  
  
Q. You said that Nicky made the biggest jump from freshman to sophomore as
any player. What precisely do you see that will blossom this year, maybe?  
BILL FENNELLY: Nicky we probably have spent as much time as any player we ever
had playing basketball in the summer. She went to camp. She went to post-camp.
She worked out a lot. I think the two things -- number one, she walks into the
building a little different. When you are 6' 3" and you are not very big, and
I am telling you, you got to play Tiffany Jackson, Courtney Paris, Sophia
Young, the look on her face was not a very good one.  
But now she walks in the gym with a little bit better confidence level. She
understands what the collegiate game is about. Her skill sets are better. She
shoots the ball better. She can take the ball off the bounce a little better.
I think she has an understanding of that first year was tough, but I think the
experience she gained in learning to play at a high level was very good.  
She had a great off-season and I think she is someone that will -- has a
chance to be very good. I am not putting her in that Tiffany Jackson, Courtney
Paris category by any means, but I do think she is someone that can go out and
impact winning.  
And I think that's what we try to tell our players all the time. Find a way to
impact the University. Find a way to impact your community. Find a way to
impact winning. And Nicky is a local player. She is from 25 miles away. So
that was -- that's something that's added a lot to our program as well.  
  
Q. Were you surprised when she said she wanted to go to point guard camp?  
BILL FENNELLY: No, because Lyndsey Medders probably made her go. No, I wasn't
surprised. Nicky, Nicky is one of those young people. She wants to be good at
what she does. I think she felt it was a way to make her game better,
understand the game better. I think that's one thing she struggled with last
year was understanding how to play the game at a very high level and do things
in relationship to the other four people around you. We play a lot different
system than she played in high school.  
I wasn't surprised. I was very proud that she did it and very excited that she
was willing to do those kinds of things.  
  
Q. Bill, who among your newcomers has stood out so far?  
BILL FENNELLY: Probably the two newcomers on our team are Alison Lacey, no
question, and Toccara Ross. Those two probably right now have separated
themselves a little bit. I will put Shellie Mosman in that category, the guard
from Carroll. If we had a game tonight and we played eight players, they would
be in that group. So I think all three of them have really done well as far as
adding what we need.  
We needed depth at guard. Toccara is an undersized four-man. But she's
skilled. She's athletic. She competes hard. She played in a great junior
college program. She has a level of maturity that's different than most in-
coming high school kids. Those three have done well. Just speaking from today
and if we had a game tonight, you would see those three early and probably
often.  
  
Q. Bill, can you talk about Oklahoma, a team that has Courtney Paris, a lot
of talent, they just keep reloading through recruiting shall plus this year
they get the Big 12 tournament in their own backyard.  
BILL FENNELLY: I don't think there is any question that Oklahoma is by far the
best team in our league. They are a team, I don't think they have any doubt in
my mind that they could win a national championship.  
To be honest with you, they have great players. They have a great coach. I
don't think Sherri gets nearly enough credit for the way she coaches that
team. You will think they have all these great players. I have coached against
her enough to know she knows what she is doing and she puts her kids in a
position to win.  
Courtney Paris, in my 30 years I never coached against Cheryl Miller and Lisa
Leslie. I am not quite that old yet. But I have never seen a kid that's
impacted the college game more than Courtney Paris has, but they have
surrounded her with good players. They play at a very high level.  
Obviously the Big 12 tournament being here is great for Oklahoma City. I think
it obviously helps attendance and puts them in a great position. It is a
tremendous team. When you start talking about great programs in this country
with sustaining success, Oklahoma is certainly one of them. They are not going
to go away. They have great support from their administration, great coach and
great players. So it is good for our league. And hopefully Baylor did it, and
hopefully Oklahoma is a team with some others that can challenge on a national
scale, because they are as good a team as I have seen in a long, long time.
They know how to play the game. The thing I like about them, they are very
humble and they can play the game in a lot of different ways.  
We played them the first game of the conference season and tried to double-
team, triple-team Courtney Paris, she made the three-point shots on us and
they beat us. We played them in the Big 12 tournament we decided to let
Courtney shoot until her arm fell off and let her break the conference scoring
record and they still beat us. They made two three-point shots. That's good
players and good coaching, finding a way to win at a high level. I think it
will be a great, great year, and I am sure the Sooner fans will enjoy watching
their team play. It will be a great thing to have for them and for the fans of
Oklahoma City and the people who put in the work here in the city.  
It will help all of us. The attendance is better. Oklahoma is down the road.
They will sell more tickets, great. The more people the better, it is
absolutely great.  
You can put this on the record, too. Sherri Coale can never complain again
because she complained all the time I had too many fans in Kansas City. They
went three and a half hours. Her fans have to go ten minutes. So I don't want
her complaining about that one. But she has earned it.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, best of luck in the season._  
BILL FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your time today.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Welcome back to everyone for the afternoon session of the Big 12
Women's Basketball Media Days._  
_We would like to welcome Kristy Curry from Texas Tech University. If you
would like to make opening comments._  
COACH CURRY: We are very excited to be part of Texas Tech and the Big 12 and
look forward to continuing the tradition that we have in place.  
_PETER IRWIN: With that opening comment._  
  
Q. What is the return of Chesley meant to the team? She is back pretty much
full strength. If you will talk about your freshman with Jordan Murphree?  
COACH CURRY: The return of Chesley is unbelievable. She is a vocal leader, an
action leader. I can't put into words to describe what the young lady has been
through. She is the epitome of what a student athlete is about. Her
perseverance of what she has to overcome to get to this point. Her presence
makes our team better as a person and player. I am proud to have her as a
senior on our team.  
We have four great seniors with Alesha Robertson and Brooke Baughman and
Patrice Edwards and Chesley, it makes your job as coaches much easier. Jordan
Murphree has the potential to be as good as anyone that has ever played at
Texas Tech. She is strong and physical. She has a presence about her.
Recruited her at Purdue, so I understand who she is and what she is about.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the biggest challenge that is have followed of Coach
Sharp and what are the biggest benefits of stepping into a program that has
been established?  
COACH CURRY: I feel very honored and very blessed to have the opportunity to
follow Coach Sharp. When the negotiations and talks first began, we were very
secure we had a top-ten team coming back. Why would you leave Purdue.
[Marsha|Marcia] Sharp has done so much for the game of women's basketball and
for someone that's my age, I have a great appreciation for all of those that
have come before us. It is the opportunity to get backs to Texas and raise my
family. The opportunity to follow her, I take much pride in following the
tradition. How can you say no to someone that has done so much for the game.  
I am not sure I answered your question, but that's pretty much how I feel
about it. As far as a program that has been established I inherited that at
Purdue. I think the two situations mirror one another. Purdue had won the
national championship. I am not bothered, not intimidated. Success before me
doesn't bother me. I think you embrace the past and you build on the future.
Whether the past was good or bad, happy or sad, you just try every day to make
it better.  
  
Q. Kristy, do you think -- are your style and Coach Sharp's style similar
enough there will be a fairly smooth transition early on this season for the
players?  
COACH CURRY: I certainly am not a brain surgeon. I understand if it is not
broke, you don't try to fix it. There is more than one right way to do
something. Some of the things Coach Sharp has in place we have kept and some
we have changed. We make adjustments, as far as the daily running of the
business, some things we are going to change, but it doesn't make one way
right or one way wrong. We have tried to embrace the past. She has been more
than open. We have daily -- conversations on a regular basis. We go to lunch.
She has had me over for dinner. She has been unbelievable to help bridge the
transition.  
I think one thing I have to really say is our kids have been open to change
and understand that we are not trying to turn the page and close the book and
write a completely different book. We are just writing another chapter to add
to the book. That's been big.  
  
Q. Also people used to talk about the difference in styles of play between
one conference and the other. I think the big 10 was known as a physical
conference. Is that still true? From what you can tell, has there been -- is
there a difference in style played between the Big 10 and the Big 12?  
COACH CURRY: I think after my first year I can answer that question a little
better. Over seven years I became one of the oldest Big 10 coaches because of
all the change. I saw different styles. Our success was that we had big and
strong. We also had quickness and athleticism. We felt like the blend together
would put us in a position to have success in the league, as it did with the
Penn State. I didn't always just like being big. I like to have quickness and
athleticism. That will make the transition to the Big 12 for us as a staff
easier.  
Having Bill Block (ph) on the staff, that was the biggest find for us thus
far, hiring him away from Baylor. He understands the Big 12 in recruiting in
this area and scouting better than anyone. So I am smart enough to listen to
him and I think he has been huge with our transition and the understanding of
what we need to get and what we have and how to utilize that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the post position for your team, maybe some
concerns there or players who you think might step up this season.  
COACH CURRY: I have all the confidence and I am really excited about Patrice
and Darrice and Erin. I think those three are as good as anybody in our
league. Certainly after that, you look at a depth factor. I like Tawanna
Flowers and her work ethic and all the little things she does. You have four
right there that have the ability to get it done.  
Will we go small? We might. We will do what we have to do to be successful
night in, night out. There is a lot that we have looked at and how we need to
be successful utilizing those four. We have all the faith and confidence in
those four. If those four stay healthy, we are okay. If we have an injury, it
will hurt us there.  
We certainly need to get bigger. We need to get better. Signing 11 players in
two years gives us the opportunity. Right now I believe in who we have and I
am excited to coach them.  
  
Q. Kristy, when you have a player like Erin, who has anchored a point guard
spot and been a team leader for a long time, when that player leaves, there is
a little bit of a void. Who right now to you seems to be the player that will
do that for you?  
COACH CURRY: I don't think there is any question that right now Brooke
Baughman will be our point guard and who is very experienced. There is no one
more fundamentally that has a better mind for the game at the one. And I love
coaching her every day. She has a great command of her team and has a presence
about her. They believe in her and she believes with her.  
And you also have two senior perimeter players on either side of her with
Alicia and Chesley. Those kids understand the game. Coach Sharp has done a
wonderful job of teaching, and I expect Jordan Murphee, Tiny Henderson, Raquel
Christian, everyone in the world knows who that is. She is a great little
player out of Midland, Texas. We will interchange some things at the one, but
it will come by committee, but I see Brooke taking the reins with that right
now.  
  
Q. Is it kind of nice being in a part of country where people don't talk
funny the way they do in Indiana, just talking about being in Texas?  
COACH CURRY: It is wonderful. My husband is an Aggie, we're on staff together,
and it is just great to be back in Texas. My accent fits. There is no better
place for my accent than Lubbock. It is great to be back in Texas and eat
Mexican food. I am as happy as I can be. I am happy to raise my two little
girls in Lubbock.  
  
Q. Kristy, what were your impressions of the Big 12? As you were in the Big
10 for so long, what were your impressions of the Big 12?  
COACH CURRY: I have to give Coach Blair all the credit in the world because he
helped me get my start. When I became an Aggie, obviously Kim and I worked
together at Louisiana Tech for three years. I was a huge fan of hers and
always supported her and we talked on the phone a lot. Both of us were having
some success at the same time and going through new jobs and just taking our
first head coaching jobs. So between Kim and Coach Blair, I kept a lot up with
the Big 12 and what was happening. You know, when you are a women's basketball
fan, you keep up with all leagues.  
  
Q. Obviously you got to view the Big 12 and what OU did last season from the
outside. What are your thoughts on that program specifically and facing them
this season.  
COACH CURRY: You just have to have a lot of respect for Sherri and what she
has done and I have a lot of respect for Norma. She has always been an
inspiration to me as a mom, as a coach. So I think our situations mirror each
other.  
We have obviously come into a little bit of a rebuilding situation, although I
see our team being better than people think we are going to be. I have a lot
of respect for her and think the world of her as a mom and a coach. I look
forward to seeing them and not have to play them, but we will play them when
we have to play them.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, we wish you the best of the luck for the season._  
COACH CURRY: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Jody Conradt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13898)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: As we resume questions from the floor for the Media Days. We
would like to welcome coach Conrad from the University of Texas. Coach,
welcome. If you would like to make a couple of opening comments or two._  
COACH CONRADT: Thank you. It is always good to be here. I wasn't ready for
that blast of cold air when I got off the plane. Otherwise, it has been a warm
welcome and we are happy to be in Oklahoma City. I think I should probably
tell you I have many more questions in regard to our team than you probably
have.  
We are coming off a very disappointing season, a season that had lot of
adversity, some of it brought on by ourselves and our lack of disciplined
play.  
But on the other hand, it is an opportunity for us to try to bounce back from
that, try to play to Texas standards which we did not last year. And I can
only tell you that I'm cautiously optimistic about what I see from our team.  
Many of the things that we dealt with last year are still in place. We still
are young. Out of 14 players on our team, 11 of them are freshmen or
sophomores, we have a difficult schedule and we are still transitioning people
back from injuries that devastated our team last year. So what I see makes me
believe that we can be successful, that we can move forward and that we can
play to our potential. But it's not going to help us at this point in time to
talk about it. It is time for us to step up and do it.  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay, thank you, Coach. We will take questions from the floor._  
  
Q. I was wondering if you can talk about Tiffany and maybe how her game can
continue to expand and maybe how here game can continue to expand and trying
not to take it all on her shoulders this year?  
COACH CONRADT: Tiffany Jackson is a special player as her time in our
conference would indicate. She has been a leader on our team in every
statistical category possible. She is a special player in terms of how she
approaches the game, how hard she works, how good she wants to be.  
Unfortunately, I think part of our difficulties last year was we put too much
responsibility on Tiffany. We were satisfied to stand back and let her do too
much and give her no support. So part of our focus has been we have to step
up. We have to play and raise our level of play around Tiffany.  
She will be obviously a big part of what we do and I think she has, as she has
each year, has increased her skill set, has become mentally tough and is
willing to take on all challenges. I think there is a significant difference
in her approach right now. Tiffany has taken ownership of this team and
rightfully so. I think she has been capable of doing that for a while but we
all have a tendency as players to defer to seniors. And Tiffany, I think, was
waiting for a time where she could nurture and bring forward with leadership
that she we were talking earlier.  
  
Q. You mentioned last year's freshmen class which was highly regarded, you
said didn't have the work ethic. You weren't calling them sophomores. You were
calling them "refreshmen". How did they respond to that kind of prodding?   
COACH CONRADT: In case you didn't understand that, last year's freshmen class
came in very highly touted. They were the number one recruited class in the
country and they believed that. And they had an attitude that made me think
that they thought it was just going to happen, that their work ethic was not
good, their focus was erratic and for the most part they didn't perform to
potential. That was also compounded by the fact that a couple of them that
were ready to play, were competitive and were talented enough to help got
injured early.  
So I have said to that group, you are re-freshmen. You have got to do this
again because it wasn't the kind of performance that you should expect from
yourself and not the kind of performance that's demanded if you are at the
University of Texas. They have handled it well.  
I think they have worked much harder. They have focused over the summer and in
the off season and have come back with a new commitment and a better
perspective of what's necessary to win.  
That's also been helped by the influx of the real freshmen class. They have
come in with a strong work ethic. They have come wanting to prove themselves
and that has forced the sophomores as well to step it up.  
  
Q. Jodi, which of the new freshmen would you expect to make the biggest
impact?  
COACH CONRADT: You know, I think all of them, there are four of them. And I
think all of them will play. But two that will play right away will be
Brittainey Raven who the coaches voted preseason freshman of the year. And she
has that kind of potential. She is very motivated and driven player with a lot
of energy. She is also very skilled. She is fast. She is quick. She has a good
size. She is about six feet tall and plays on the perimeter. She has the
ability to be a good player and I think will make a difference early. A player
not quite as well-known as a player named Niqky Hughes. She has some of the
same qualities Brittainey does. She is very competitive. She is all over the
place with her energy and her effort and right now I believe that she will
also play a lot.  
The third player is a player named Kristen Nash. She has been slowed a little
bit right now. She has an ankle injury that has kept out kept her out of some
practice. She is a heady player. She loves to rebound and do the little
things. I think all three of them, just their energy level and their work
ethic will make us better.  
A fourth one is a player named Gabriell Mattox. She is a player you might not
notice right away. She is steady and she wants to be really good. So all of
them, I think, have a chance to play. Brittainey, I would be forced -- hard-
pressed not to think that all of them are going to get significant playing
time.  
  
Q. Jodi, Carla, last year, of what we saw of her was pretty phenomenal. It
had to be tough to have her go on the shelf. What kind of shape is she in now?
Do you feel she can be sort of the person who leads this team?  
COACH CONRADT: I think Carla is one of the biggest keys and at the same time
one of the biggest questions. She is recovering from knee injuries and you
know that's not something that just one day you are recovering, the next day
you are 100%. So she is transitioning back. She had a little muscle pull that
slowed her a bit. She is still the most efficient player, the most headlines
player, the most competitive player we have at the point position.  
We know that's a key role that has to be filled. We are counting on her
heavily. Her transition back from the surgery and being able to get into a
full-scale practice day in and day out, that may not happen for a while
because it doesn't typically with knee injuries. But she has to be there for
us to be successful.  
  
Q. Jodi, talk about Erika and what you are going to need from her this
season?  
COACH CONRADT: Erika had the hardest role of all of the freshman because we
threw her on the court early and we depended on her for a lot of our scoring.
She is really talented as a shooter. I don't think I have coached shooters
that are as consistent as she is with her ability to score. As you saw last
year, we made her stand on her head, twist up and down and do everything
imaginable to be able to get a shot off because we weren't very good at
helping her. And I am hopeful we will be a lot better.  
She has come back with, again, a new focus and her intensity is excellent. She
is working hard on every phase of her game, and she still is an incredible
shooter. And I think you will see her have even more success as we learn how
to help her in that role.  
  
Q. Jodi, can you talk about the unanimous favorite Oklahoma and on top of
that having to come to Oklahoma City and then hosting Big 12 tournament 30
miles away from their campus.  
COACH CONRADT: From what I saw from Oklahoma last year, they don't need any
advantages, so being close to home, at their tournament certainly generates a
lot of excitement and enthusiasm for the tournament itself. I can't imagine
there won't be a big turnout of people who will want to support their local
team. And it hadn't happened previously, and I don't know whether it will
happen again, that we will have a team go all the way through the conference
schedule without a loss. That in itself is a strong statement about how good
Oklahoma was.  
We saw a player unlike most of the players in our game. Courtney Paris is
unique. We haven't seen players with her size and mobility who could literally
on the block as she does and that made Oklahoma really -- a difficult task to
defend. I am sure they are going to come with the same kinds of mind-set. You
like winning and you like being a champion. That in itself motivates you to
improve and to come back and repeat. So they are there in my mind.  
They are there in the mind of all the coaches as a favorite in this
conference. All of us are still trying to figure out how to contend with
players like Courtney and a player who is surrounded by other strong players
and players who do other things really well.  
  
Q. How about playing here in Oklahoma City?  
COACH CONRADT: From what I have seen, I think Oklahoma is excited about
hosting this event and the men's tournament. You want to have a lot of
different experiences. You travel and being in a new environment is always fun
and I think that there will be that in Oklahoma City just as there was for the
first time that our teams went to Kansas City. It says to me that women's
basketball is alive and well in Big 12. We have our choice of a lot of venues,
a lot of venues that want to host the tournament and are capable of putting on
a premium event and I suspect the same thing will happen here.  
  
Q. Jodi, what about having Clarissa, one of the best players in the history
of your program, now having her on the coaching staff and specifically how she
can help a player like Tiffany and your young post players?  
COACH CONRADT: We talked about the addition of the freshmen, but the most
important addition to our team and our squad might be Clarissa Davis-
Wrightsil. Most of you in this room know who she is and what she accomplished.
And that is different from our players. I say about this generation, if it
hasn't happened in the last ten minutes and it didn't happen to them, they
don't know anything about it. But those of us who have been in women's
basketball know what kind of player Clarissa Davis was. If you look at her
experiences since those playing days, she played professionally in two leagues
in this country. She played overseas in about four different countries.  
She was the C.E.O. of a startup franchise in San Antonio and what people
didn't know about her was that she was also teaching and coaching in summer
leagues and on summer teams. She brings all of that experience to our program
and I was very amused and excited to see what the players, how they responded
the first time she walked -- into the gym. And I don't think they have taken
their eyes off of her since that time because she demands that kind of
respect, she is a wonderful teacher and the connection that she made
immediately with our players, I think, will be evident over the course of the
season.  
  
Q. Jodi, we talked about the extremely successful OU. My question is about
the opposite end of the spectrum, OSU, O-16, what does Kurt Budkey have to do
to lead that program back to respect built?  
COACH CONRADT: Well, I am not looking forward to my trip to Stillwater either.
I know Kurt's history. I know he has been successful at every level and it
takes time. He has done a great job recruiting and I think anybody that plays
and follows what happens in this conference knows that you can't take anything
for granted. I have had some of my tensest moments in Stillwater and I didn't
feel comfortable the last time we were there.  
I know they will be competitive, and I know they will be fighting to improve
on what had to be a disappointing season for Kurt and his staff and his team
as well. That's what competition is about. You see what the standard is and
then you work really hard to get there. We have seen in this conference time
and time again programs that were obscure, programs that might not have had a
history in women's basketball but suddenly you're faced with the prospect of
going and playing them and it is frightening.  
  
Q. No surprise, you always have a pretty tough nonconference schedule.
Generally you guys play the toughest of any Big 12 team. That's been the case
several years in a row.  
Talk about this young team playing. You have got Duke, Tennessee, Purdue, New
Mexico, those are the names that stand out right away.  
COACH CONRADT: I think we sort of figured out last year that we might have
outdone ourselves with the schedule. I talked about last season being the
perfect storm. Seven freshman, injuries and a tough, tough schedule. And we
didn't cope with any of that very well. So we did try to temper the schedule a
little bit. But I think you will still see Tennessee, you will still see Duke
and going to New Mexico is no picnic.  
We do have a tough schedule, but hopefully we can gain a little confidence and
feel better about ourselves as we compete again the elite programs because I
don't think you know what you have to do unless you face it. Just as I
mentioned, where is the level of competition? We got to find our level and,
hopefully, our level will be up there with some of the best teams in the
country. Unless you go on the court with them, it is hard to know where you
are and how you stack up.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, thank you very much. We wish you the best of luck for the
season._  
COACH CONRADT: I appreciate it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Sherri Caole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15816)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Good morning, everyone, to the Big 12 media days for Women's
Basketball. We are delighted to have everybody out this morning._  
_A little bit of information about the format and how we will be conducting
these interviews this morning. First of all, we'll have each coach on the
podium for 15 minutes and they will be here and take your questions and then
they will move on to another area for some other interviews._  
_At 10 o'clock, we will bring the first three coaches that are up here and
they will go behind the curtain with their student athletes. And when they go
behind the curtain, the student athletes and the three coaches will be back
there to take your one-on-ones. We will have approximately an hour for you to
do the one-on-one with the coaches and the student athletes._  
_By the way, out of respect for the student athletes and coaches, would you
please turn your telephones off or at least put them on vibrate._  
_And with that said, Coach Coale, we are glad to have you here from the
University of Oklahoma. If you would like to make some opening comments and
take questions._  
COACH COALE: I am excited to be here today to formally kick off the Big 12
season with Media Day. I am glad we could find a room that was large enough
for all of us. This is nice and intimate.  
I am absolutely excited about the tournament, being in Oklahoma City,
obviously, and gathering here today for Media Day.  
It is awesome for our city and I know the city is excited about hosting the
event and they are very well prepared to do so.  
And I like it because I actually get a day off. I don't have to travel this
afternoon. With that being said, let's get after it.  
_PETER IRWIN: We will take questions. We have two people with stick
microphones since this is a large room. We have a question right here on the
front left and we will start right here. Wait until we get the microphone,
please._  
  
Q. Yes. It was a great year last year. All your starters are back. Can you
talk about the expectations of your team this year to do us well and you have
a great recruiting class even on top of that. So do you mind all these
expectations? Do you like them or how do you feel about that?  
COACH COALE: Absolutely I like them. I would much rather see us listed in the
top five in a preseason poll than to be searching for our name in the list
that follows at the end of the 25. It is a lot better deal to have high
expectations. We knew that coming in. You go 19-0 in league and you return
five starters. We knew what the expectations would be and yet our kids
understand you have to play the games. You have to show up and compete every
night.  
And what we did in Big 12 conference last year was not easy and a lot of
things happened our way and we understand that. We have to continue to get
better every day. And to focus on the task at hand and adding five new guys is
no easy thing either, no matter how talented they are. We lost two incredible
seniors who are were very much a part of how good we were together last year.
When you lose that leadership, you have to make a transition in leadership.
There are always new challenges presented. We are embracing these expectations
and we can't wait to get started and see what happens.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question all the way in the back. ._  
  
Q. Coach Coale talk about the predicted strength of the Big 12. You are
favored, Baylor is two-years removed from a national championship and they are
picked fourth. You will have a real dogfight up near the top.  
COACH COALE: Big 12 conference is always incredibly competitive. As we went
into the NCAA tournament last year and we are talking about seeding and
selection and all those things that people talk about around the first of
March, we are looking back going -- we won 16 games in league play and won the
tournament. We look at each other as coaches and say, how do we do that? Look
how good Baylor is, Texas A&M is and Iowa State, you go down the list. It is
no different this years. The players have changed. Some of the superstars may
be a little different. But there was a lot of young talent in the league last
year, that has more experience and there is a lot of new talent this year. So
it should be an exciting season.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the front. Tom._  
  
Q. Sherri, Courtney was almost unstoppable at times last year. What in the
world can she improve on?  
COACH COALE: I wish I had a dollar for every time anybody asked me that. I
would buy so many shoes it is not even funny. What can Courtney improve on. A
myriad of things. As coaches we pick apart the game. She got 20 rebounds last
year and I would be on her in the locker room for not blocking out. There are
all kinds of little things. You can't play basketball perfectly. While she
does a lot of really dominant things, some days she does things in practice
and in games where I shake my head and say it is good to be me today. She is
on my team. She is a remarkable athlete.  
There are still a million mistakes made on the trip down the floor. Where you
will see Courtney improve, she gets better in a myriad of areas. You won't go,
Oh my gosh, suddenly she has some big perimeter game. That won't be the deal.
You will see she goes left as easily and fluidly as she goes right. You will
see she positions herself on a lackadaisical defender, a little quicker or
sharper than she did the year before. You will see her block out a little bit
more, I hope. And you will see her make a few more free throws, I hope, and be
a better help defender.  
You can go down the list of all the things that are important for a team to be
successful on both sides of the ball.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the front left. Just one moment while we
get the microphone._  
  
Q. Hey, Sherri. Couple things, first, you sort -- do you see any similarity
between 2001 and 2002 where you had a team that was good enough to make a
Final 4 run, had a disappointed Sweet 16 loss, came back and made the Final 4.
We can talk about that. Second, it is a little ways down the line, but you
will have one of the other best centers in Jessica Davenport coming in. Have
you thought about that matchup from a standpoint of having two of the best
centers in the country in Norman in December?  
COACH COALE: I will start with the first one, Michelle. There are a lot of
similarities between this year's team and the team that went to the
championship in 2002. I think the greatest similarity is probably how the
previous season ended as you alluded to. We had a very disappointing loss
against Washington the year before in San Antonio. Disappointed last year in
San Antonio by a very good Stanford team. We talked about that in the locker
room, Michelle, after that game. We talked about the necessity of staying
hungry and making sure that you don't feel this way again next year and
knowing that no matter how well you may be playing, the road can fallout from
underneath you in a heartbeat.  
The sad part, those two seniors, Lauren and Becky, don't have another shot,
but everybody else in the locker room did. That has buoyed us throughout the
summer. If have you a tendency to go through the motions, you remind yourself
it can stop in a heartbeat. I have six more guys that have a shot. That was
the sense of urgency that propelled that team in 2002, six seniors who knew
they had a shot to come to Oklahoma to do what they needed to do.  
This class feels that sense urgency in a similar way. Your question about
Jessica Davenport is more a question about Ohio State. We went there last year
and competed in the ESPN big Monday game and really outplayed them and they
scored on the final shot and they won. And it was a great, great game for
women's basketball and it was a fantastic game for Oklahoma basketball because
we figured some things out there.  
And so the only way we really circled that one on our calendar is just we have
another shot at them and they are at our place and we want to make sure we
finished what we started.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the front left._  
  
Q. Talk about the rest of the conference and who the other top teams look
like to you.  
COACH COALE: I'm sorry. I couldn't understand you.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the rest of the conference and who looks like top
teams to you .  
COACH COALE: Absolutely. Texas A&M I think is really talented. Gary has done a
tremendous job of getting a lot of kids in there who can play the way he wants
to play. They will get after you and pressure you for 40 minutes and I think
they will be very, very dangerous, not just at home, but on the road as well.
I think Texas is probably not getting enough consideration. They are a very,
very talented and they weren't that far away last year, even though there were
some games that the score indicated they were that far away, they weren't.
They were talented and young. They had key injuries. Those guys are back and
healthy. You mix those guys together and add Brittainey Raven to the group,
that squad is pretty good.  
Baylor with the addition of Bernice, obviously they will be talented. I never
count Iowa State out. Bill Fennelly can coach. I never count them out. I think
it will be a very, very tough conference slate.  
_PETER IRWIN: Question on the front right._  
  
Q. Sherri, how soon do you expect the freshmen to be contributing on this
team?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I don't know, Lynn. First half of practice yesterday I might
have said November. The second half of practice, 2010 maybe. I don't know.
They just had so much to learn. I tell you what, I love this freshmen class.
We have five and I just love them because they are passionate about playing.
It doesn't matter if you are asking them to run a drill, if they are getting
to play live in a scrimmage situation, if you are teaching them specific
things that are very hard to learn about offense, they just love ball. It has
been neat because they have a collective confidence that I think is really
rare and very, very special in that I can correct them and correct them and
correct them, and we do, and they still believe that they can play and they
can beat anybody. And I love that sort of inter-resilience, if you will. They
know they have a lot to learn, but they also know they are very capable. And
they have been an absolute hoot to coach for the first five days. I don't
know. I don't know, it may be a different one at a different time depending on
what we need because all five of them are so different and can do different
things. We will wait and see. Collectively they have a chance to be a real
special group.  
_PETER IRWIN: Michelle, we will get a microphone to you in a moment. On the
left-hand side._  
  
Q. Can you sort of talk just on a national basis obviously Maryland was a
little bit the surprise winner with a lot of young kids following Baylor which
surprised a lot of people. Do you sense even this year there might be even
more potential national championship contenders?  
COACH COALE: Yes. I think parity is greater than its ever been. That sounds so
coach- speak. But the last three or four years I think it has escalated
steadily. I think there are more teams that have a chance to win a
championship and obviously Tennessee and Connecticut are still in that mix.  
But there are just a couple of -- a handful of people who are every bit as
talented and every bit as likely to get it done. I think when one team does --
I think what Baylor did is significant, in that it sort of lifted the ceiling
for everyone, there is no entitlement in the sport. There is no entitlement in
women's basketball. If you do the right things and you compete and you have a
few breaks along the way, really, really special things can happen.  
And Maryland proved that last year. A very young team and I would say there
might be as many as 10 or 12 that are seriously in that hunt on this side of
it. You start playing games and that may change dramatically. People may move
into that group that we are not thinking of right now. People that are in that
group might move out of it. Right now I think there are several teams that
have a legitimate shot.  
_PETER IRWIN: We have a question on the front and then we will get back to the
middle._  
  
Q. Sherri, will you talk about Leah's role? She probably will play in the
same or similar role for two straight years. Can you talk about what you
expect from her this year.  
COACH COALE: Leah Rush is a basketball player. If you ask me what her position
is, I couldn't really tell you. She is just a basketball player. She can
score. She can defend. She can rebound. She will take all the tough effort
plays. There is no doubt about that. I think she is more comfortable this year
than she was last year moving away from the basket. I don't think she was real
comfortable playing at the block when we brought her in, but it is what we had
to do in order to have a chance to be successful. We were undersized and we
needed her presence there. She never blinked and went right to playing a five
as an undersized post player and competed and got comfortable at it  
And we said now come out here and do this for a while. I think for a little
while last year she pressed and tried too hard and couldn't find where her
niche was within what we were trying to do. I think as the season went on, she
got better and better and better, as was evidenced by her play in the NCAA
tournament. But there is a spring to her step and a confidence and a sense of
security and calmness, if you will, about her game right now. She knows
exactly how she can score, where she can score from and she is doing that very
well right now.  
_PETER IRWIN: Question on the right side._  
  
Q. Sherri, what is it about this area that leads you to believe that it will
be a successful host for the conference tournament?  
COACH COALE: Oh, my goodness. I think the first thing I think of is a very
selfish thing, but we have sold almost 8,000 season tickets. Basketball is a
pretty big deal in this area right now. I think that the Hornets being here in
Oklahoma City has increased basketball awareness, maybe changed a lot of
people who were just athletic fans but maybe not basketball fans. They have
learned a little bit more about the sport and maybe gotten attached to it a
little bit.  
I also think that you look at the all-college tournament that's held here
every year and the phenomenal attendance that shows up for the men's games.
There are lots of factors. The biggest one being that people in Oklahoma love
sports. They absolutely love sports. And Bricktown has become an incredible
venue for all kinds of things from concerts to sporting events. And I think
that not only the local people, local people will show up in droves, but I
also think the fans that come in will have a tremendous experience in this
venue.  
_PETER IRWIN: Further questions for coach? Right up here in the front. This
will be the final question for Coach._  
COACH COALE: We're going to end with Clay? I will take a deep breath for this.  
  
Q. Along the same lines from this comparison from the Final 4 season to this
season, what I remember about that season was you guys not being afraid to
talk about it, not being afraid to say yes, this is where we want to go. You
probably try to keep them in line with the "one game at a time" as the season
went on. But nonetheless as we talked about the Final 4 a lot, where are you
guys with that right now? Is it out there in front? Is it the first things on
your mind or what?   
COACH COALE: Well, absolutely. Clay, I just have a bone-deep belief if you
want to do something, you better think about it, read about it, remind
yourself about it every single day. And I don't want our players or our
coaching staff to put themselves in a position where what they think about and
what they read about and what they spend their time on every single day is not
what they talk about with you guys. We want to win a national championship.
That is the goal.  
And we understand that you don't have a chance to win a national championship
if you don't take care of your business. Along the way, a part of that, a very
important part that have is winning the Big 12 title because that puts you in
a position to have a better chance throughout the NCAA tournament. There are
lots of things that come before that. We will not make any bones about where
we are trying to go. That's the deal.  
_PETER IRWIN: Okay, Coach. Thank you very much._

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach Budke has joined us from Oklahoma State University. We
would like to welcome you to the podium and make an opening comment or two and
then we will take questions._  
COACH BUDKE: I figured out one thing. When you are picked 12th in the
conference, you go last. That's all right. I can handle that right now.  
There is no one more excited to be here than me today. We are very excited
about this upcoming year. We obviously had a very tough first year, but I knew
when I took the job it was going to be a tough first year. And I appreciate
how the kids competed and we made the best of what we had, but we went out and
we signed the 12th best recruiting class in America. We have nine new players.
And our early practices have been tremendous.  
And it is really exciting as coaches coming into the gym every day and getting
to work with these new players. So we expect -- we expect to take a step this
year.  
  
Q. Having so many new players is pretty rare, I would say. Is it a good
thing as far as you are concerned? Just maybe a complete overhaul, is that
what you would consider it?  
COACH BUDKE: I think it is a good thing because we knew we had to upgrade the
talent. We're -- obviously I think we are in the greatest league in America in
the Big 12. I don't think any women's basketball league from 1 to 12 is better
than what we are playing in.  
And that was one of the advantages last year of not having any expectations,
is getting a chance to go through the league and figuring out exactly what we
do need to win in this league. It is exciting because the new players coming
in, we went out and we tried to recruit winners. We tried to recruit people
that have had success at the high school level and at the junior college level
and they expect to win. They don't care about the past. The past is over. We
are ready to move on and we are ready to go out and compete this year.  
  
Q. Kurt, as successful as you have been everywhere you have been coaching,
how difficult was last year for you personally?  
COACH BUDKE: You know, I will be honest, it was. I knew it was going to be a
tough year but until you actually live through it, it really was tough. You
know what was tough on me, probably was I understood as a coach where we were
at and what our limitations were. It might have been tougher on my family, my
kids. Their dad has never lost before. My mom and dad, their son has never
lost before. My family, my friends, my relatives, my college roommates, they
would call me all the time, Hey, are you doing okay? Are you going to be all
right?  
I was fine. I knew as a coaching staff that we went out every day and we
prepared our team to win a ball game every day. We didn't cheat the kids at
all. And they didn't quit. They never quit all year long. As a coach, if you
know you are doing your best and giving your team the best chance they have to
win, that's all any of us can ask. We survived it. The Good Lord doesn't give
you any more than you can handle, and we handled it well and we are ready to
take the next step.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just maybe pick out two or three of the newcomers who
might make the biggest impact?  
COACH BUDKE: I think and Andrea Riley will make a big impact for us. Freshman
point guard. I have had some great athletes over the years. She is as quick as
any player I have ever had in my 20-plus years. I think she has a legitimate
chance to be one of the top five freshmen in the Big 12. She is definitely
going to get the playing time to put the numbers up to be one of the top
freshmen in the Big 12.  
I think last year if you saw us at all, we had to walk the ball up the floor.
We had to sit in the zone defense. She is going to bring a whole lot of
excitement to the gym and she is going to -- she is going to -- as the
Oklahoma State fans come out and watch, they are going to fall in love with
that young lady for the next four years.  
I think her and I think Rashidat Sadiq, who probably set out last year
transfer from Connecticut has a chance to be our leading scorer, has a chance
to be our leading rebounder. We only get her for one year, but she is well
worth it.  
We are really excited about those two. I can keep going down the list. I think
one thing we are better at, we do have depth this year. I think we can go
about ten deep. And all the other girls will have their night. The good thing
about our early practices so far is we have kind of had -- we kind of point
out a practice player of the day, someone that has had an exceptional day and
I think it has been someone different every day. So we are excited about that.  
We have a lot of people that can make contributions this year.  
  
Q. Kurt, the Big 12, you have ten newcomers, have you lost one?  
COACH BUDKE: One is a register. We have a transfer from Rutgers who
transferred this year.  
  
Q. Kurt, you said that last year you had a chance by going through the Big
12 season to figure out what you needed and you have already stated you
defined winners, people that will come in with that kind of mentality. What
else did you garner from last year's Big 12 season? What types of players and
what style of play?  
COACH BUDKE: I think when you are in the Big 12 South, like we are, and you
need to increase your athleticism. There is just some unbelievable athletes,
especially in the south part of the Big 12. That's the biggest thing. We need
to pick up our team speed. We had some people that can run like a Chris Hood,
who is here today, but we had nobody that could get the ball up the floor fast
enough to get it to her.  
But we think we solved that problem. I am not saying we are going to come out
and run and jump and press 40 minutes. We are not to that point. But we are to
a point where we can go out and do some different things defensively and try
to be on the attack a little bit.  
Last year, we were always just trying to take care of the basketball, just
trying to get it up the floor and not throw it away. And defensively we were
trying to shorten the game, play it sitting in the zone so they wouldn't have
as many possessions. We feel this year we can get out there and get after it
just a little bit more.  
  
Q. Kurt, just looking at the schedule, you guys have a trip to Hawaii. I
think you only leave the State of Oklahoma once. I think that was probably by
design having so many new people, maybe having the aid of being at home and
getting some consistency in play.  
COACH BUDKE: I really -- Michelle, I went back and looked at some of the other
programs and what they did in building their programs at Baylor and A&M and
looked at their schedules, and they kind of did the same thing we did. I am
not saying we can win every game in our preconference schedule, but we have
given ourselves a chance by staying at home and competing against teams that I
think we have a chance to beat.  
We just want to build momentum, Michelle, as we get into Big 12 because
obviously as you know, once we get into the Big 12, there is absolutely no
give-mes. Coach Holder has done a wonderful job as our athletic director,
coming to me as the women's basketball coach and saying, what do you need to
be successful? What's it going to take to get us on the top tier?  
I think one of those things was scheduling and have as many home games as we
can. Our administration has been great with women's basketball.  
  
Q. Kurt, with last year's season with Oklahoma having the great success that
they did, 16-0, and with your first season being on the opposite end of the
spectrum, recruiting such a big part of it, what do you say when you are going
out to all these kids in Oklahoma homes that know what kind of success
Oklahoma is having, what do you say to sell your program?  
COACH BUDKE: I think the biggest thing right now is an opportunity to play,
they look at it like there is an opportunity to play right away, and some of
the other more established programs in the Big 12, you might have to go in as
a freshman an sit for a year or two and share time and get ten minutes a game.  
I think some of the recruits have looked at my past and have seen how I liked
to play the game and how we like to get it up and down the floor. At Louisiana
Tech we were always in the top five or ten in the nation in scoring and that's
how ultimately we want to play.  
It is amazing how many Louisiana Tech people are in this league now with Gary
Blair and Kristy Curry and Kim Mulkey, you can see the style of play that
every one of them like to play and that's where we want to get to. I think
recruits recognize that.  
And I still have one big advantage on my side and that's Gallagher-Iba arena I
think is the best basketball arena in America.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about that, that is kind of fascinating to have
four -- Kim played there and coached there. A lot is a reflection on Coach
Barmore, a way that all of you guys developed your style in coaching and how
your teams play.  
COACH BUDKE: Coach Barmore, I don't know if he will ever get the proper
respect for what he did at Louisiana Tech. I mean, he is not out at Tennessee
or Connecticut. If you have ever been to Ruston, Louisiana, it is about as big
as this room. For him to build, I mean, his record of 14 final 4s and from
Ruston, Louisiana, is unbelievable.  
We got to learn from the master. And I don't think there has ever been a
greater coach in women's basketball than Leon Barmore, and getting to watch
him every day and how he handled his players and handled his practices, it has
helped me. If you look at the success of all the other coaches, it has helped
them, too.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, I think they will let you off easy. Have a great season,
Coach._  
COACH BUDKE: Thank you all very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 18, 2006

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
_PETER IRWIN: We would like to welcome Coach Gary Blair from Texas A &M
University. Coach Blair has agreed he will make an opening statement or two
and then take questions from the floor. Welcome, Coach Blair. _  
COACH BLAIR: I used to be somebody when I was at Dallas, Southfork Cliff (ph)
and he was our PA announcer at our track meets there. And he has come a long
way and hopefully I have, too.  
But eventually, when we retire we will be the two best Walmart greeters you
have ever seen in your life and we will be very good at it.  
It is good to be in Oklahoma City. It gives us another conference. It gives us
another venue and place where we can get people excited about women's
basketball. Already Oklahoma and Oklahoma State have always done a good job
within the state. But this is one of the best unknown high school areas in the
country, and good high school ball because I grew up coaching six-on-six
basketball back when Charles Heatly (ph) was getting it done, most of you all
don't know anything about, but he was the best high school coach probably in
the state back then and it was special.  
I signed a kid when I was at Louisiana Tech named Tasha Brown from Tulsa, and
people say I was crazy signing a six-on-six basketball player from the state
of Oklahoma. She helped us win a national championship and she had a great
career and I think she is back coaching in high school now in Tulsa.  
But we are excited to be here. We are overrated, we are underpaid, and other
than that, that's the same as what your job is because most of you are
underrated. Most of you need a clothing allowance a little better than you
have right now, but at the same time, I am glad to be here. Let's go.  
Questions? That's my journalism degree at Texas State. Didn't mean a whole
lot, so I decided to go on to coaching.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Morenike. You say freshman year this is a kid
that will be a star in this league, and just how she has developed and how she
has developed in terms of playing your style of defense and still being the
offensive player she is?  
COACH BLAIR: She's probably the most under-recruited kid that's a star in the
Big 12 Conference now. I mean, we beat out a couple of schools and everybody
else passed on her, including the schools in her own state, LSU and Louisiana
Tech. I knew what she was all about because I knew what that high school coach
there was all about, and he produced Alana Beard from the same program. I
think she is special because to me, she sort of like is a free safety on
defense, sort of like a Roy Williams because all of a sudden she is all over
place deflecting balls, getting blocked shots, and a majority of her shot
blocks come off of defense.  
And that's what our defense is all about, is being able to help because we are
going to pressure the ball, we are going to gamble, and she is just sort of
roving in lanes out there getting the steals and the blocked shots and the
deflections.  
I think Morenike will some day be a very good WNBA player. But right now we
need her. We need her to do for our program -- she only averages 14 points a
game and that's our leading scorer, but we need for her to elevate herself up
to that star status that could also help us in recruiting. It could help us in
the big-time crunch games when you have to go against an Oklahoma or a Baylor
or somebody like that, to be able to deliver on a consistent basis. I think
she is just very confident of herself, both on and off the court right now,
and that's just making her a better person.  
She is always the one that the community service programs, they always want
her to come and speak and she is very good at it. She played very well this
summer over in Europe, and all of a sudden you look up and she was not playing
more than 19 minutes a game and she would have seven deflections, seven steals
and ten points or so. It didn't look like she was sweating out there.  
Remember, folks, this is going to be only our second year of playing outside.
She was a post player in high school and a post player for us her freshman
year. So she is just learning the game and the perimeter. And hopefully in
years to come, she will make one of those USA teams. She has tried the last
two years but hasn't made it. That just tells you how many great players there
are in the country today. There are that many that are better than her and
that's why the USA is as strong as it is.  
  
Q. Gary, what do you feel like your trip to Europe did this summer, did for
your team? Did it build some togetherness?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it is a tremendous thing. I read a story, I forgot who
did it, a couple weeks ago, a pretty good article about the highs and lows
where some people believed in it. I believe in it wholeheartedly because it is
an education experience taking your kids to the Louvre and taking them to the
cathedrals and letting kids see something that probably the majority of you
all haven't been to Europe. I hadn't been in 31 years. To be able to see
things that we read about, that we listen.  
I think it gave our kids an awareness and appreciation also what we have over
in the states, it made us appreciate the Europeans. They make every inch count
over there, and their land and how they grow things over there and they are a
whole lot cleaner than we are over here, to tell you the truth. There is not
much litter over there. And they speak four to five languages. I speak broken
English, okay? And I admire them for who they are and what they are doing and
what they have.  
They don't -- I think it was good for our team, the quality of competition
past the first game was not as good as I would have liked because they were
just starting their seasons. But the first team we played over there was a
good French team and I think we won by nine. It also gave my kids -- no one
played more than -- we had 11 kids, 12 kids play and we had from six to 11
points on ten of those kids. So we were spreading it out, trying to develop a
backup point guard while we were over there, trying to play Danielle Gant all
on the outside this year, trying to develop confidence in our post players to
be able to score, where before we were such a perimeter-oriented team. We went
over there trying to become an inside-outside team.  
So we were able to work on some things. And other than that, I enjoyed it as
much as the kids. I really did. I think it was a great trip. And basketball
travellers, they do it right. They know how to combine both the educational
part as well as the basketball part at the same time. We were over there with
the Pepperdine men, and their coach was a first-year coach, and so he was a
little bit more geared into his team. I was a little bit more geared into us
enjoying the whole cultural experience.  
  
Q. Last year we talked about Courtney Paris. You said this freshmen when it
is all said and done won't just be the best player in the nation, she may be
one of the best women's players, period. There was a lot of awe when you made
that statement. Now you look back and it seems very accurate.  
COACH BLAIR: The thing is we do our job sometimes when they are eighth and
ninth and tenth and eleventh graders. We can tell when a kid is going to be
that good. The thing that makes Courtney Paris so good, I think, is the
charisma that she has off the court. I think she is going to be one of the
best ambassadors for Oklahoma, like an Adrian Peterson or back to the Sellman
brothers and that type of kid. She is going to be that for Oklahoma, just like
Cheryl Swoops was for Texas, and Sophia Young for Texas.  
We are still trying to find that one person like that at Texas A&M, and
hopefully maybe it will be Morenike some day when she gets out.  
But then at the same time, what Courtney is doing, she has got the best hands
I have ever seen for a kid of her size. I mean, she is just -- she is just
very special because post players today handle the ball as well as guards, and
all of a sudden, when it is thrown in there and she has got that ball and you
got Higgins cutting this way and Welch cutting this way and Leah Rush in the
middle, you need to be an air traffic controller to see which is the best
option to stop.  
The best option is to foul her before she passes off to one of the cutters.
She is very good. But it is good for our conference right now, to have a
player like her in our conference. I just hope she declares for the draft
pretty soon.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the enthusiasm for basketball at Texas A &M all
the way around and men's, women's and just what you have seen from the
community.   
COACH BLAIR: Most of you all are all from out of town, of course. You just
don't realize what's happening there right now. Can you picture A & M
University all summer long, people are talking basketball, not necessarily
football or how good McGee is going to be or whatever, but they were talking
about basketball. And it is a very special time right now and we are doing it
at the same time.  
And that's what's the most special time because there has been good teams
before, but there hasn't been that rich national presence of basketball. We
are still growing. They are reading about us. Our media is doing a great job.
Our marketing is doing a good job, but we are not selling the place out yet
and that's up to us. That's why Coach Gillespie (ph) and myself are out there
doing everything. We are out there working hard. I like to say he is Elvis out
there and I'm Jimmy Buffet or something like that.  
Right now, he is the best thing going just about in men's college basketball.
He is as good as a coach you can see. Just go to one of his practices and
watch the intensity. It rubs off on our kids. It rubs off on me.  
I am very lucky to be associated at the same time that he is there. Just think
how many great men's coaches we have in the league and when we had Coach
Sutton and now we have his son and we have Coach Nye at Texas Tech and we are
fixing to have his son pretty soon, and all these guys that are out there. It
is a special time for Big 12 in basketball. And we want A&M to be, with our
new arena, most of you do not know about it, they will start digging on
December 1st, $17 million expansion on the new practice gyms, offices, the
weight and training center and all that, is going to be very, very good. And a
lot of that we copied a little bit off of Oklahoma, what they are doing here,
what they did at Oklahoma.  
And it is going to be a special time, but it is good to be a basketball coach
right now. But still, neither one of us are doing it. We are parade All-
Americans right now as some of our teams in the conference have. What we have
got to do is be able to get that elite, elite athlete to say, Hey, I want to
play basketball at Texas A&M, and let A&M be a destination.  
And hopefully in years to come we are going to have that. Other than that, I
think we are both coaching them up pretty good right now. We both got good
staffs and we have a town that's very, very hungry for success.  
  
Q. Gary, as the coach of the team that's expected to contend with OU and
picked second in the preseason polls, can you talk about the Big 12 tournament
being in Oklahoma's backyard.  
COACH BLAIR: I would love to play Oklahoma at the Big 12 tournament because I
know what game I would be in probably. But no, seriously, they are picking us
second right now. Like I said, they have to pick somebody second. The coaches,
it is a conspiracy. They are picking us second mainly because they want all
the pressure on us right now. They know we have never been picked that high
ever before. It is a conspiracy out there. Picking second through eighth in
this conference will be very hard.  
It is easy to pick who is number one right now. They have proven it. They have
all the horses back. They have a great recruiting class. They have Coach Coale
back. We don't worry about Oklahoma right now, but we sure worry about
everybody else in the Big 12.  
Texas is going to be a whole lot better. Don't rule out Texas Tech. They are
picked too low. My golfing partner over here on the right over there, Coach
Budke, folks, he has gotten new players. His golf game still sucks but he has
ten new players out there. He is going to be very, very good, okay?  
You just get behind Oklahoma State because they are going to do the same thing
in the Big 12 South that we did three years ago, same year is going to happen
at Oklahoma State.  
Now, instead of the Big 4, there used to be in the Big 12 South, there is
going to be a Big 6. And it is going to be a great basketball conference.  
Did I answer that question or did I go heading off in another direction?
Halfway got it.  
_PETER IRWIN: Coach, you did a great job as usual. Thanks for being up here
and being with us._  
COACH BLAIR: Thank you, all.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2006

  

### [Mario Chalmers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13724)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Julian Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13723)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_MODERATOR: We'll go to you first, Coach. Your thoughts on today's conference
Championship._  
COACH BILL SELF: It was a great game. Of course I wouldn't be saying this if
it went the other way, but two teams playing at a high level for vast majority
of 40 minutes.  
I don't how many league changes there were or ties, but there were a lot. We
played great. That's the best we probably played all year. I thought Texas was
really good. But down the stretch I just thought we executed and got stops
defensively and of course rebounded the ball a lot better than we did the
first time we played them.  
_MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Self._  
Q. What were you able to do to take LaMarcus out of game?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think fouls helped. He got a couple relatively early the
first half and he still played the majority of the first half. But he got, if
I am not mistaken, I don't know exactly, a quick third and a quick fourth when
he checked back in. He's a great player, and we were unsure even during the
game do you trap him or not. But fortunately for us, we did not have to make
those decisions for us because he played out of foul problems more. But our
big guys are good post defenders. Sasha and C.J. can both guard very well and
they did a good job on him.  
Q. How much does this win lift your team with tournament coming up?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I don't think there's any question that it should give
us great confidence. Last year we went into the tournament on kind of a down
swing and this one we're certainly on an up swing.  
But playing well this week doesn't guarantee anything next week. But I think
it gives us great confidence and the atmosphere and everything will be
comparable to an NCAA tournament type atmosphere. So I think we got a lot out
of coming to Dallas this week.  
Q. Hawkins played pretty well in the tournament?  
COACH BILL SELF: Yeah, he was great.  
Q. Is he a bigger part of the offense and do you have confidence in him
taking those guarded threes in big games like that?  
COACH BILL SELF: I have got a lot of confidence in him right now. I like for
our guys to shoot the ball. If they guard hard they can pretty much shoot it
every time they are open. They play smart enough to share it, and when another
team plays zone, Hawkins becomes very, very valuable and Texas played a lot of
zone which allowed him to get some shoulder squared jumpers. Fortunately for
us he made them. He played very well the entire three day weekend though.  
Q. Your younger players talked yesterday about wanting to prove kind of a
tone for that last game. They played great all year, but do you think this is
still a lift for them?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think it is a lift, yeah, I think so. These guys, they have
only played in -- last 22 wins they have only played -- well, every win we
have had this year, 25 wins, only two of them have been single figures. So
they have played pretty good. Then of course 5 to 7 losses were on the last
possession.  
So we have been in games -- but I really think the Oklahoma State game
probably did as much for us as any game because we need to win a close game, a
grind it out game. We were okay yesterday, but today we played at a level that
we haven't played at consistently all year long, and it was so good to see
because to get all 5 guys, regardless of who they are, on the floor, working
together like that, was something that we needed to see and that's even with
Brandon having an off night.  
Q. This season you haven't played a lot of teams that are going to be one or
two seeds for the NCAA?  
COACH BILL SELF: We played one today.  
Q. Exactly. Will that win over Texas, does that give you a lot of confidence
that you can compete with those kind of teams?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think some. We have got truly good players, and they are
playing to their talent level a lot better, and -- but I think so. But the
thing about the NCAA tournament, you can't look to see who the one or the two
is with you. We know firsthand we got to take care of business whoever we're
playing the first day and obviously that won't be -- I don't think will be
seeded such where you will look and say, well, that's definitely a win.  
I think it will be a situation where like last year or four or five or
whatever, that we're going to have a very tough opponent first game, so I am
concerned about our guys believing they are good enough to play with anybody.
But we need to not be looking too far ahead. We need to take it one day at a
time.  
_MODERATOR: We're joined by Julian Wright from Kansas._  
Q. Bill, when we look at McDonald's All-Americans we always look at offense.
Great athletic ability. Did you see the defensive potential in Robinson and
Chalmer and Wright or does that kind of surprise you how good they are?  
COACH BILL SELF: Mario, I mean, Mario and Julian and Brandon done were
obviously -- Brandon wasn't a McDonald's guy, so it was Mario and Julian were.
And I will be honest with you, the way they played in high school, Julian only
averaged about 13, 14 points a game, so he was a complete guy. It was easy
sell for him. I think it's been an easy sell for Mario. Russell, that's who he
is. Russell came here, that's who he is. I think Julian would agree that's his
mindset. He's the heart and soul and pulse of our team more than anyone else.  
And the other guys, C.J., Sasha, Darnell, those guys weren't McDonald's guys.
Those guys weren't highly recruited. Those were guys that didn't score points
in high school. So it was an easy sell for them if they want to help the team
do this and that, and certainly they have done that. These guys have bought
into guarding probably better than I thought they would at this age.  
Q. Talk about that pass you are making from the high post, seems like Sasha
catching the ball much better now. Is that a matter of doing that through
three, four months and then getting used to that pass?  
JULIAN WRIGHT: Definitely. We work on that a lot in practice just high, low,
also being aware of the ball and knowing that that's what I like to do. I like
to distribute the ball, me and Sasha developed a good chemistry in terms of
where we like the ball, where he likes the ball to score. He's a big body. I
know he's going to get to the line, get big man in foul trouble, put pressure
on them, and the guards were able to knock down shots too.  
Q. Can you talk about 32 points off turnovers. Were you surprised at how
many points you were able to get off that when Texas only had 7?  
COACH BILL SELF: They only had 7 when? They had 16 turnovers.  
Q. Points off turnovers?  
COACH BILL SELF: I am sorry, okay.  
MARIO CHALMERS: We were kind of surprised. First game they got us when we
played them at their house, they kind of scored off our turnovers. Today we
tried to bring a lot of defensive pressure to them and make easy baskets off
their mistakes.  
Q. Talk about what it means to win this tournament coming from where you
guys have come from at the middle of the -- at the middle part of season with
all the talk?  
JULIAN WRIGHT: It means a lot to me and to everyone. Just the way that we
became -- we have become a team, you know, team oriented, everything we do
outside of the court and everyone is ready to work and make sacrifices.  
That's the big thing this year. We were able to just bounce back from when we
were 1-2 and look at us now, we just try to, you know, listen to Coach Self
and coaching staff and try to get better day by day.  
MODERATOR: One last question for Coach Self.  
Q. No trophy presentation in Manhattan, but this one might have been a
little bit sweeter today?  
COACH BILL SELF: That kind of got blown out of proportion in how that went
down. And the league certainly told us that it was kind of a mishap, so
there's no hard feelings on that deal at all. But I think in a weird way, it
might have helped us because, you know, we did tie for it and our guys maybe
probably didn't feel the same way the Texas kids felt when they tied for it.
No fault to anyone, but certainly it was nice to hold that one today. I know
the guys really enjoyed that.

### [P.J. Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13721)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH RICK BARNES: Congratulations to Kansas. We made a lot of mistakes with
the ball and they turned them into opportunities and scored, and that was the
difference in the game.  
_MODERATOR: Let's go to questions for our two student athletes. We'll come
back to Coach Barnes._  
Q. Talk about the Kansas defense in the last five minutes of the game.  
P.J. TUCKER: They played pretty good defense, but I think it was more of us
just bogging down on offense and not doing all of what we were supposed to
have done.  
I think that we still, you know, are a good team but we just -- that last five
minutes we didn't tough it out as we should have.  
Q. Following up, particularly on Julian Wright, maybe the two biggest plays
of the games he comes up with steals. Can you reference those two plays, how
big they were?  
P.J. TUCKER: When you gets caught up in the moment like that it's coming down
to -- everybody is trying to make a play and trying to get their team going,
so he came up with two big steals that was probably two of the biggest plays
in the game, and just plays where some players, especially myself, just trying
to make something happen when there's nothing there.  
Q. Did you see anything missing mentally internally here for you guys at
all?  
P.J. TUCKER: I don't think that we displayed being the same team that we
usually are tonight today. They came out, played really hard, got to give
credit to them. They didn't give up at any point in the game. We definitely
just let down. We weren't the team that we usually are today  
BRAD BUCKMAN: I agree. We weren't the team like we were at the end of the
season. But it happens, and we're going to learn from this and our season
starts the big -- I mean, March Madness starts next week, so we have got to
worry about that right now.  
Q. What did you notice about them that was different than when they played
in Austin?  
P.J. TUCKER: I don't think they played any different. They still did mainly
the same things they did in Austin. We played different. We never gave up. We
kept attacking, kept on making big plays, and we played hard the whole game. I
don't think it was more of them. I think they still did the same things, but I
think we were a totally different team.  
Q. Particularly after the first two games, what were you looking for out of
yourself as far as effort and results in this one?  
BRAD BUCKMAN: You know, I feel like I was a no-show in the first couple of
games. This team deserves a lot more out of me than I gave them first couple
of games. I can't have that now. I am a senior. I should know what I have to
do every game, and I let my team down in the first couple of games.  
I can't be having that coming into next week because it's All-Star next week,
so, you know, I wanted to be a lot more effective this game. My shots is not
falling and I got to do some other things besides shooting the ball.  
Q. Can you guys talk about the atmosphere today, what it was like, how that
can prepare you for what you will face in the week coming?  
P.J. TUCKER: A lot of times we're used to playing on the road anyway because a
lot of games, called neutral games, we end up -- seems like we're on the road
anyway. So we're used to it.  
Crowd today was pretty good, we had a lot of fans. They did as well, so it was
a tough game. These are games you can expect in the first, second round after
tournament. Just getting us prepared for next week.  
BRAD BUCKMAN: Obviously they had a lot of fans; we had a pretty good amount of
fans. That's how the environment is going to be from here on out. We have got
to get used to it. We have seen it before, we have to understand that that's
how it's going to be the rest of the games.  
Q. Same question I asked the guys, anything intangible about today's game
that concerns you at all?  
COACH RICK BARNES: No, none of that at all other than the fact that it's
pretty simple, you look at the line, I mean, they scored 32 points off
turnovers and they shoot -- end up for the game 44 percent. You take away
those turnovers, I don't think they would have shot that high a percentage.  
And the biggest difference, if you want to look at the line, LaMarcus didn't
have the game he had in Austin, that was obviously the difference in him
having to be on the bench there. But again, even with that, the two turnovers
that Julian Wright made, you can say what you want to say, those were two big
plays. But we come out and make two free throws and we missed three of them,
it's a one-possession game and we'll see from there.  
We don't make the plays we had to make, and that's the most disappointing
thing. Give them credit for what they did because they did the things they had
to do. We didn't. Taking care of the ball again, you turn the ball over 16
times and a number of those being unforced, that's the most frustrating part
of it.  
Q. You just touched on it, LaMarcus, 5 points and 5 rebounds in 28 minutes.
What did they do to take him out of the game?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't know. I can't tell you that. They obviously came
in, tried to be physical because they have got -- I am sure they are sitting
there thinking they got 20 fouls to give there and they were being very, very
physical to start with and getting him off the lane a little bit.  
He had two fouls, he had a foul where he -- the illegal screen, which I don't
-- probably would tell you that's not necessary for him to do. And he reached
in on a ball screen which he didn't need to do. Those are the kind of plays I
told him all year that it takes him out of the game, he's not as aggressive.
He picks up a couple of fouls, but they shot the ball. They made 12 threes,
but a lot of that has to do with the fact that our turnovers gave them some
breathing room.  
I would have loved to see if we made those free throws with a one-possession
game, see what happened in the last couple of minutes. But we didn't do our
part to get it to that point.  
Q. Just two quick questions. How do you think this loss affects your team
with the tournament selection committee? How does it affect your team
period?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I can't answer the first one at all. I can't answer that.
But in terms our team, we talk about different seasons that we play, you got
your none-league schedule, regular season, and a conference tournament. I'd
say that we have done pretty well except getting the final result in this
tournament.  
Even if you win this tournament, it doesn't matter, starting next week it is a
whole new basketball season for 65 teams and if we do what we have done in the
past, we'll bounce back. We'll learn from it. And better now than later
because we definitely can do things better than we did today. We're going to
have to, or this is what happens this time of year. It's single elimination,
it's not a series here. But you know, it is what it is. We lose today, and we
have got to get ready to play. I think our guys will.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

  

### [Darnell Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13718)

### [Russell Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13717)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH BILL SELF: I don't think we played with the same energy we did last
night. We made shots. You make shots. You always look better offensively.
These two guys played great, Russell a fabulous second half. We did what we
needed to do, but certainly can improve in a lot of areas before tomorrow.  
Q. Talk about the change in intensity, what it was like trying to get into
the flow after the big game last night?  
RUSSELL ROBINSON: Came out, made some plays early. Mario came in, hit some
shots. Just tried to feed off of that. That's what happened the rest of the
game.  
Q. How much are you looking forward to playing Texas again? Why do you think
this time it will be different?  
DARNELL JACKSON: It will be a lot bigger because we went to their house timid.
Julian played great for us. We're going to need Julian. C.J., Sasha, we're
going to need all them tomorrow to help us bang through Marcus. And Buckman
down there at the post.  
Q. What does it mean to you to have a chance to be the first Kansas team
since '99 to win the conference tournament?  
RUSSELL ROBINSON: Pretty big opportunity. This is something that we have been
looking forward to this whole season, and now we have the chance to go out
tomorrow and play with a lot of intensity and do the things that we need to do
to win.  
Q. You had a fairly big advantage inside, and you guys go at the Cornhuskers
in waves whereas they only had one guy. Talk about the edge you guys had
inside?  
DARNELL JACKSON: On first side we were playing kind of soft. I shot a fadeaway
jump shot, that's not my game. I'm a physical player, so I love contact. They
get in foul trouble. They knew they couldn't foul or they would have fouled
out of the game. So the only thing they could do was wall up and it gave the
big man's a chance to turn around and shoot a jump up.  
Q. Can you follow up on the Texas question, we were beaten on the boards
much more so than we have in other games this year. Is that something as a big
man, and the four big men kind of hurt a little bit more than other factors,
other statistics, and you think it can be different tomorrow?  
DARNELL JACKSON: Yeah, I think it could be a lot different. This is going to
be a good game tomorrow. Especially for me because when I went down there I
was scared because it was a big game. I had the jitters and now tomorrow I am
just going to have to play my game, rebound.  
Q. Your thoughts on the rematch with Texas?  
RUSSELL ROBINSON: They got us pretty good the first time. But we learned a lot
from that loss and just going to come out tomorrow just try to make up for the
rebounding loss we had last time and just try to bang with those guys and be
physical, try to come out with a win.  
Q. Texas had to kind of fight for their win this morning. How much of
advantage is it for you to be able to lay off in the second half there?  
COACH BILL SELF: I don't think that's an advantage at all. We had to fight for
ours last night. So the league is balanced and we said all along that there's
not that great a discrepancy in the teams but I do think it's great that Texas
and us get to play one more time and they certainly whipped us the first time,
no excuses.  
And we're going to have to play at a lot higher level than we did that time in
order to have a chance to play with them. As far as advantage, disadvantage, I
don't think they shot it good today, we didn't shoot it good. We shot it good,
they didn't. That doesn't have anything to do with tomorrow. I think both
teams will have energy and get a good night's rest and be ready to roll.  
Q. How much of a factor will playing in a neutral court have to do with
tomorrow since last time in Austin?  
COACH BILL SELF: Home court always plays a role, but we have been a decent
road team. We actually played better on the road this year a lot of times than
we played at home. We can't say that because it's on a neutral floor we'll
play better.  
Be honest with you, everything is different. Oklahoma State, we won that game
by 15 at their place and on a neutral floor, it was a one possession game. I
think, you know, I know the first time we played them there was a lot of
energy in the building. I know they really fed off of that much like we did
last year when we had game day at our place. I think the home court is worth
something, but be honest with you, I don't know that that will an factor one
way or another tomorrow.  
Q. The 3 point shot helped you guys pull away a there in the first of half.
Talk about Chalmer and Hawkins?  
COACH BILL SELF: Yesterday we made three shots outside of six feet for the
game, 3. Today, if we did not make shots, the game would have really been an
ugly offensive game for us because they played boxing one and played zone the
majority of the time. You have got to make shots when teams do that.  
That was obviously a huge factor when we weren't probably guarding like we
normally guard at least in my opinion, to get out to a lead because we made
shots. We didn't play a lot better than Nebraska we just made shots. Certainly
that cures a lot of ills.  
Q. As hard nosed as your kids are and as tough as you play, when you hear
Darnell say being timid or being scared, does it bother you?  
COACH BILL SELF: No, it doesn't at all because we have talked about this a
lot. We had a different feel that game than we have other games. I think the
biggest reason is this -- that was the first big, big game that these guys saw
as a game of that magnitude that they have ever played in a lot of them. So it
was a first time experience for a lot of these guys.  
Darnell was new. He was never depended on to win or lose a game last year. It
was a different deal. And I really felt like from the look of our team, that
we approached that game differently than we did the other games. When you say
timid, I think that's probably an accurate response. We certainly -- I don't
think that's a sign of softness. I don't think it's anything like that. I
think it's just some young guys going through things for the first time.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

  

### [Barry Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13707)

### [Aleks Maric](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13719)

### [Wes Wilkinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13720)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_MODERATOR: Coach, opening comments regarding today's game._  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: Well, I felt like that our team battled as we have the
last couple of games. The key I think to start out the game was that Kansas
made some shots against our defense from the perimeter and really had us
spread out somewhat. Then they went inside.  
Jackson had a great game off the bench. Hawkins did the same thing for them.
Chalmer was a real key. And then on the offensive end, we weren't able to
score with any consistency. Largely because of their good pressure defense.  
Q. Talk about past two days then coming in today, obviously for any team to
win four games in four days is a tough challenge. What was your energy level
coming into today and looking at playing a good Kansas team?  
WES WILKINSON: I felt like we had good energy today. We knew we had to play
with heart because it's difficult to play three days, three games. It is a
mental challenge. I felt like we were ready. Like I said, we just had to come
out and play with heart and intensity and take it game by game.  
Q. Talk about the athleticism that Kansas, particularly their young back
court, showed out there today.  
WES WILKINISON: These guys are a real athletic, talented team. They are really
good defensive team as they have shown, and on offense they can convert, run
the court, they are real young, that's key. They have people that can shoot
the ball. They are an all and all around good team.  
ALEKS MARIC: They got all their players can jump through the roof. Very
athletic. Made it tough for us rebounding, getting up and down the court.
Obviously they can run up and down. Good transition team. That was the key.  
Q. Discuss the spark that you got going down here in this tournament, how
that can carry into the NIT, what you hope to accomplish there?  
WES WILKINISON: We knew we could play good against Missouri. We lost that
close one at Mississippi, they made a good run at us. Once we got that win, it
boosted us a little bit with confidence. Once we got out of that first round,
it was just playing hard and playing with heart, every day is a new day. We
had to come out and play hard.  
ALEKS MARIC: We need to carry this momentum on. We can't look at stuff today
and put our heads down. Hopefully we'll be in the post-season come Sunday, so
we need to carry the momentum.  
I am very proud of my time, what we have done over the last couple of days. No
one would have expected, outside of Nebraska, for us to accomplish what we
have here, so very proud of my team.  
Q. Talk about you guys didn't get out of here until so late last night.
These guys probably weren't in bed until pretty early this Monday. Did that
have any effect on your energy level in the game?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: We're not looking for excuses. It is a factor, but they
played a game yesterday as well, and the one thing that you know is that as
the coach of this team I know that they want to keep playing, so they found, I
think, the mental energy. It is a difficult challenge, of course, but no
excuses, Kansas outplayed us and they deserve to be the victor today.  
Q. Do you expect to be the coach of Nebraska next year?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: As far as I am concerned, I am the coach of Nebraska
until I hear different. I don't know any more than that. I don't really have
much more comment than that.  
Q. Seemed kind of a strange sight their athletic director is 15, 20 feet
away from you in an open door and talking quietly to a bunch of reporters. How
do you react to that, I mean did you expect him to say something in support?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: I don't -- I just try to coach our team and I am very
grateful for the opportunity to do that. We're going to get ready to -- we're
going to keep our fingers crossed for a nod on Sunday night to play. That's
where my focus is going to be.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Josh Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16449)

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

### [Acie Law IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15070)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: Very competitive game against a great team, and I think
we got not a great team but a pretty darn good team ourself, and give those
guys credit for winning. They did a great job. We couldn't handle them in the
lane and too many offensive rebounds, too many drives to the basket too close
to the basket. We kept competing, gave ourselves an opportunity. But we just
never could get the stop when we needed it or the defensive rebounds to put us
over the hump.  
Q. Talk about at that final -- not the final play, but the play where Joseph
ended up taking the three-pointer, what happened, what were they doing
defensively?  
ACIE LAW: They was in a man. We worked on that play, double down, me to come
off the ball screen, set the down screen for Dominique or Josh and Joe to pop.
We knew that they was going to smooth it down like two -- down two or three, I
am not sure. We was going for a 3. And I knew they was expecting me or
Dominique to shoot the shot or Josh. We always work on that play in practice,
Joe the pop out on the back end of it. LaMarcus made a great defensive play.
Joe didn't make the shot and was downhill from there.  
Q. Josh, what was your situation on that play because you had been hitting
3s all day?  
JOSH CARTER: Well, me or Dominique come off the down screen and Dominique just
happened to be over there, he just came off and I was just in the corner just
in case Acie just came off the screen and he could drive and penetrate and
pitch to me.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
JOSH CARTER: Well, no, the guy was guarding me Acie went the other way, so
wasn't open.  
ACIE LAW: It's my fault. I should have took the ball that way and made a play
for him. But I just -- I knew that way I was going to go back to Dominique. I
knew he was going to go to Joe, I had confidence in Joe, Josh had been hitting
the whole game, and I should have went and made that play for him. I had
confidence in Joe to make that shot for us, and he was just unable to make it
for us.  
Q. Talk about Josh last two games, what he has brought to this offense?  
ACIE LAW: Great for us, not only offense, he has been doing a great job
rebounding. He's getting better each day defensively. He's just maturing.
Shows you all the ability he has here in the Big 12 when things are getting
tough, everybody is stepping up, raising their game up, trying to defend real
well. Josh has done a great job showing everybody what he can do, and the sky
is the limit for him if he just listens to coach and works on his game,
because he has got a lot of talent.  
Q. On the play that Joseph ended up taking the 3, the way you talk about it,
is Joseph on that play actually an option to take that 3 --  
ACIE LAW: That's the second option. I am going to come off the board screen,
then it is a down screen or Dominique and they played the down screen well and
Dominique recognized it and he went to Joe. Joe just didn't make the shot. If
we were in that situation again, I would run the same play, give it to
Dominique -- I am sure Dominique would give it to Joe because Joe would make
that shot for us in that situation.  
Q. Can you discuss Tucker's effect on that game? It's one thing on offense,
late they switched him on to you --  
ACIE LAW: He's a great player, player of the year in our league. He can do it
all, all type of plays. He's great for them. He had 26 and 13, just dominant
performance. He's a great player, I mean, that pretty much sums it up about
P.J. He's just a phenomenal talent.  
Q. Speak to just feeling it in your hometown, I guess, how comfortable you
have been shooting it up here?  
JOSH CARTER: I am always pretty confident in myself that I can make shots.
They were just falling this weekend. It was good to have it at home, but I
mean, it would have been better if we would have won.  
Q. There's some guys in Indianapolis right now that are deciding who should
be in and who shouldn't be in the NCAA tournament. What would you tell them
about this team?  
ACIE LAW: I think we should be in, but like I said before, it's out of our
hands. All we can do is just sit back and pray and hopefully they will let us
in. We think we deserve to get in. We think we did enough, but it's up to the
committee. I don't know that look at or what of you hopefully they will let us
in sounds sound at end.  
Q. Follow on that the NCAA tournament, what do you think you are chances
are?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: What do I think? I am not a politician. I haven't been.
I won't be. You don't have to be when you play in the Big 12. You finished
fourth, you win your first game in the tournament, you play a team that's
hopefully going to go to the Final 4, unless we get put in the same bracket,
and you know, there's no question we have won 8 in a row. I don't know if
anybody has a longer winning streak our last four losses that we have had over
the season have been today, Texas on the road, Oklahoma on the road and Kansas
at home. All those guys are pretty darn good. So we're going to get to keep on
playing in the NCAA tournament and I think we're going to represent this
conference very well. Thank you.  
Q. Talk about how -- the movement of the ball today? You guys had 19 assists
only 6 turnovers.  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: I thought we did after we got started, they were
scoring too much on us, we couldn't get them slowed down at all, and they did
a great job in transition of putting the pressure on us, but what we were able
to do is make some shots and we started playing inside out and Acie did a
fantastic job. He's really come to be a great player. He's always been a good
player but he's become a great player, offensively, defensively,
leadershipwise, everything. He got the ball where we needed to.  
He made so many good plays that don't show up anywhere in the stat charts of
getting guys shots, moving guys where they needed to be, getting the ball in
the post, putting guys in position where they can get the ball to the post. He
played a fantastic game for somebody that really -- I am not saying -- I am
not saying someone here doesn't, but if you really understand basketball, man
alive, it was one of the best performances I have ever seen.  
He didn't shoot it as well as he does sometimes, but man alive, he played a
great game. I am not disrespecting anyone in here as far as basketball
knowledge. So many little subtle things that he did to make everybody on our
team much better put him in great positions to score. That's the reason we
were able to come back and have a chance to beat a really good team.  
Q. What does it do for your offense when Josh is shooting the ball like
that, and has his defense improved that much where you are able to get him
more minutes?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: He was a little overmatched defensively. Those guys are
really hard to guard. They did a really good job of attacking us off the
dribble, because that's the way you attack pressure, we tried to pressure. We
didn't do a good enough of -- we were always on our heels in the first half
because they were just gripping us into transition. And when they got it down
there they were just beating us off the dribble. We weren't in help position
close enough to help enough. And not only Josh, but just too many guys got
beat off the dribble.  
But those guys are extremely hard to guard off the dribble because they can
all shoot it so well. So Tucker is a good shooter. Those other guys are great
3-point shooters. But he's just a hard guy to stop off the dribble. It's hard
to keep him out of the paint. That's where the game is won. They got the ball
in the paint too much. When they missed too much, they controlled the
offensive board in-the-paint and we had a lot of opportunities to get
defensive rebounds and tried to keep them out of the paint, and we couldn't do
it. They just whipped us in the lane today.  
Q. Did you make somewhat subtle switch with Joseph Jones as to where and
when and how he was posting up between the halves?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: No, not really. I don't think that Joe was sealing his
man as well as he needed to in the first half. Against the zone, I thought we
had a lot of opportunities after ball reversal for Joe to seal a little bit
better in the first half. He was open, so he didn't feel the need to go and
seal his man away from -- of where the ball was, and he changed that a little
bit. I am not being critical of Joe at all. That's normal thing for anybody to
do is if you are open you are going to stay where you are, but he started
posting up a little bit closer to the basket against the man and zone in the
second half and he probably was a little bit more effective.  
Q. On the play when -- 10 seconds when Joseph took the 3, what did you see
as the play was unfolding? Did you expect him to take that shot, were you
hoping that it could get in the hands of maybe one of their other 3-point
shooters?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: Joe can shoot the ball as good as anybody on our team.
But that -- he shouldn't have shot it today, and Joe knows that. They did a
good job. We didn't set as good a screen as we could have. I like the play. We
didn't have to have a 3-point shot. I thought that Acie was going to come off
a double screen even though they were trapping it.  
I thought I was going to be able to either get in-the-paint and score and get
us a two or penetrate and pitch for Josh, or I thought Dominique would get a
double screen and shoot a 3 or continue the play. But when we reversed it, all
our guys have great confidence in each other, and me too. It was my fault
because I called that play. Looking back I probably should have said let Acie
go flat with it. It is a good play. I thought Acie might drive it on the first
side anyway, penetrate and pitch for Josh or Dominique.  
As you can tell, when you ask these guys, nobody -- nobody wants to put the
blame on anybody else, and that's why they are a good team. They should say,
Coach didn't know what he was doing on a lot of things. But they never do.
They always say, well, it was a good play, I could have done this or whatever,
that's why it's such a special group.  
If you ask anybody on our team what happened, they would say, well, I didn't
do this or I didn't do that, or we didn't do this well enough or whatever.
That's why it's a special team and it's so much fun to coach. But it was my
fault. I probably should have either called another timeout right there and
told them exactly what we wanted to do, or just reminded Joe that we didn't
really need to have 3 point shot at that point. But when he gets it I am
totally confident he can make it.  
Give Texas credit. That was a big play, but that wasn't the play of the game.
Plays in the game were all in-the-paint on the other end when they drove too
much and couldn't get a defensive rebound. Give those guys credit. Good luck
to them. They are a great team.  
Q. Talk about how the complex of this matchup has changed now that you have
your program where it is?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: Well, I think that we're getting to the point to where
hopefully one of these days it's going to be a rivalry. We're working towards
it. We have unbelievable respect for them. I was watching our guys shake their
hands before the game and I think we're to the point to where people have
unbelievable respect for us too and that was really a nice sight for me. It
was also good coming in to -- we're going to try to emulate has done with
their program and they have done a fantastic job, Coach has done a great job
of making a national power on a yearly basis. We're going to try to emulate
that as best we can. It's very difficult to do.  
But one of things coming into the tournament that I thought was really good
for Texas A&M is Colorado came here wanting a piece of us, and we played very
well yesterday and they have got a really good team and today Texas was really
mad, wanting a piece of us, and I thought our guys performed well in both
games against two really good teams. I think just because of that, I think
that we're making strides in the right direction. I don't know if that has
been the case in the past.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Kenton Paulino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15645)

### [P.J. Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13721)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH RICK BARNES: First of all, we really beat an outstanding team today, a
team that we respect as much as any team we have played this year and the fact
that they play hard. They compete every possession.  
But I am also proud of these two guys on our team because when we had to make
some plays, we made it. P.J., I think, showed today why he's the player he is.
Not only you look at list line, his rebounds, his points, but defensively what
he's done for us, the play at the end of the game where we switched him over
to guard Acie Law and made a great played there, the drive and dish down,
passing, he's a complete player.  
Kenton made a huge basket for us when we needed. Daniel Gibson steps up makes
some free throws. Great team win. Again, it's what you'd expect this time of
year, a hard-fought game and being a close game and come out with it, it's a
good win for us.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
P.J. TUCKER: Just I just got the ball in my hands. He just tells me to go make
a play sometimes and drive whatever is open, just take it. And that time Brad
happened to be open when I drove the ball, so I got him the ball.  
Q. P.J., how long have you been waiting for another shot at A &M? How much
did it motivate you?   
P.J. TUCKER: I think all week everybody has been talking about getting a
matchup with A&M just because how we ended the game last time we played them.
Truth be known, it don't really matter who we play. I don't think we all came
into this tournament thinking that we just want to play A&M because they beat
us. We just wait and see what we're going to play next game. Whoever we play,
we take a look at it night before and get ready to play.  
Q. P.J., was there some extra motivation for you because rightfully or not
you took a lot of blame in that A &M game with the shot clock violation? Did
you come out with extra motivation to show what is up?   
P.J. TUCKER: Not at all. I would be motivated anyway. Anybody on my team can
tell you I am a motivated player every single game. I haven't played Big 12
tournament since my freshman year, so I am motivated here by getting a chance
to play. I don't think specific teams motivate me, but just playing basketball
does.  
Q. Would you describe how the play unfolded where you made the 3, how the
past came to you and all that?  
KENTON PAULINO: Play was designed for P.J. to get the ball, just create
something. Unfortunately he missed the shot and LaMarcus, he grabbed a big
offensive rebound, he kicked it out. My feet was set, so just let it go.  
Q. As a senior you have seen this A &M series change a little bit. How much
better are they now, because this game seems to be so much different than,
say, it was three years ago?   
KENTON PAULINO: A&M is a totally different team. They are more competitive
than they have been in the past years. With Acie Law and Joe Jones, what they
have done for that team, you know, with them getting a new coach, they made a
complete turnaround.  
Q. Can you react to the fact that Joseph Jones took that shot? I mean, he's
taken 19 3-pointers all year. What is going through your mind as to where the
final shot came?  
P.J. TUCKER: We knew we wanted to take Acie Law out, make sure he didn't take
the shot. Try to put the ball in somebody else's hands for them to make the
play because they look for him to make things happen. When Joseph Jones got
the ball, I particularly wanted to try to deny Acie Law the ball and make sure
he didn't get it back and make it Joseph Jones, that's the shot we really
wanted.  
KENTON PAULINO: We just didn't want Acie Law to catch the ball to him to
create something and get an open look, so we wanted somebody else on their
team to make a play.  
I think the play broke down and Joseph Jones ended up being the 3-point line
and he took the shot, but we just we wanted to contest everything.  
Q. There was a time where you it almost looked like you ran an ISO as it
cleared out I'm going to take this thing in. Were you getting the feel that
there's nothing that's going to stop me from taking it to the hole?  
P.J. TUCKER: My teammates and coaches, a lot of times the shot clock gets low,
they might think I've got a mismatch so we were cleared out and just make
something happen. Not just to get a shot for myself, but a lot of times to
free up Ken or LaMarcus to get a good look at it because people come and
gravitate to me a lot.  
As I said, it's the trust I get from my teammates and Coach to make a play
happen.  
Q. What happened in the second half that allowed them to slow it down and
get it more into their pace of the game, and surprised that LaMarcus only got
two shots in the second half?  
KENTON PAULINO: I think we turned the ball over a couple of times and they
made some 3s, they got back into the game, but I that I was due to our
turnovers.  
Q. Since you guys and Kansas tied for the regular season title, would it be
fun to play them in the Championship tomorrow?  
P.J. TUCKER: I guess so. Like I said to the first question, it really doesn't
matter to us, really doesn't. Playing Kansas would be fun because they are a
great team, but playing Nebraska would be good too because they gave us a
pretty good game at home when we played them. Really doesn't matter. Going to
sit back, watch the game and after the game is over analyze the teams, see
what we are going to do tomorrow to play.  
KENTON PAULINO: Same thing: Whoever we play we're just going to prepare for
them tonight, just come out and play them.  
Q. 27 wins, a new record at UT. Any thoughts on -- a little history?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Not really. Haven't thought much about it. I think you
probably, when the season is over with, you might reflect on that. But right
now, I said it a couple of weeks ago, I think we still got work to do and it's
not time to sit back and think about that right now.  
Q. The Aggies, as you know, have made their mark by their tough, gritty
style, winning games at the end. You like what happened with your team when
things got tough late today?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I really do. One, I can't -- I could sit here for a long
time and talk about the job that Billy has done with the program and I have
got a lot of respect for the fact that guys -- teams that play as hard as they
play and compete and to be there in a game like this -- this is what it is
this time of year. And you can have a lead, we watched it happen yesterday,
you watch it unfold in the Big East with Syracuse down, coming back. You watch
it all week. This time of year is what it is.  
For us to do what we did today, making the plays, I do think players have to
make plays at games. Ken was a big player. P.J.'s defensive rebound where he
took it away from LaMarcus was huge on the other end. Daniel going through the
free-throw line, Buckman's one was a big one. There were a lot of big plays in
it.  
Being a close game and the way the guys carried themselves I thought was
really good. P.J.'s defensive play on Acie Law was a great play when he came
out, stayed in front and we had a foul to give. I said to him, if you get a
chance to go for a still, go for it. Once he picked up his dribble I would
have preferred him not to give it right there, but he did anyway. That was a
big defensive possession and P.J. did a terrific job on that possession.  
Q. Is P.J. the toughest guy in the conference to guard?  
COACH RICK BARNES: He is tough because he can give it to you a lot of
different ways. And, again, people will look at his line, 26 points, 13
rebounds, and he didn't have a great day shooting it from the free-throw line,
which he's pretty darn accurate. But his rebounding -- but it's what he does.
He said it, we diagramed a play that we wanted to get guys in position, wanted
to play, we had designed, we were going to throw it back to him, let him make
a play. But we had Brad and LaMarcus on the backside to get offensive rebounds
kind of using Daniel as a decoy and Kenton was going to play off P.J. and P.J.
turned the corner, made a great read.  
We could work and work and work, but he made the play, players make those
plays and he has got great vision and he can give it to you a lot of different
ways. And, you know, the tough thing about this time of year too when you are
in conference play, I mean, Texas A&M can probably come in here, talk to you
about everything we do. They know our people, our personnel, as we do them.
You got to work to get things done this time of year once you are in
conference tournament time.  
But P.J. is special, he is. His mindset, what he has got, I don't know if I
have ever coached a kid that it means as much. This game means a whole lot to
him, and it's always been well-documented what he's gone through. And he
responded to that one question like I thought he would. I don't think he had
any more motivation. He's one guy that he lets things go and moves on to the
next play pretty well. He's not going to beat himself up very long, but today,
this time of year, you would expect him to do what he did today.  
Q. Because of what he's been through, do you get any satisfaction -- are you
happy for him as a person because he could -- he took so much flak for that A
&M thing?   
COACH RICK BARNES: I love him. After the game, first thing I said to him, I
said, you know what, you have won a lot of games for us. I said, before you
are done, you are going to win a lot more. You love anybody as a coach that's
going to give you everything he's got. And he does. He gives it to us every
day. It's not just a one-time thing. I mean, you know, when he -- I don't even
know if I can tell you if he's ever had a bad day in terms of practicing. What
he does off the floor as a person. He's a great person. He really is. He's all
about his team and I have said to him before, one of his greatest strengths is
probably he's stubborn and sometimes that's probably one of his biggest
weaknesses. I kept telling him, they are going to surround you, do this, do
that. He looks at me, he says, they ain't taking it from me. That's the way he
is. Believe me, I am glad he plays for us.  
Q. Could you talk about the plan to defend Josh Carter late in the game?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, they obviously can shoot the ball. Our zone has been
good the last couple of days, people have -- again, people know how to play
against us. But we have switched back and forth a little bit between the 2-3
and a 1-2-2 zone, 3-2, any way you want to write it.  
They can shoot the ball. We knew they were going to do that first half. We
didn't cover out very well. A lot of the 3s he got was really from pretty good
defense where we got out there, and all through double penetration, Acie Law
made a couple of terrific passes where he got us up and got into the gut of
the defense and kicked out. It is just naturally when somebody drives you are
going to help on that. He kicked out, they started making some 3s.  
But we think we're a good man team. We think our zone is best when we mix them
both up, and really and truly we stay in that zone based on how people handle
it. If they're not handling it, we're going to stay in probably longer than we
like. I think sometimes -- and I tell the coaches this all the time, I like
when we play man because I feel like we're more aggressive on the offensive
end. But sometimes people aren't hitting shots. Handle it, we'll stay in it
until they do.  
And but we knew coming in. They proved yesterday they could make a bunch of
3s. But we ran well out of the zone first half, we really did. Got a lot of
good transition baskets out of it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

### [Joseph Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13903)

### [Acie Law IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15070)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_MODERATOR: Coach Gillispie, your thoughts on today's victory._  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: It was a great performance by our team. I am not a
bragging type, but our guys really played well against a really good team, a
very, very, very athletic team that makes you play -- you have to be right on
everything or they are going to get you. They have so many athletes they play
so hard and so well coached. They were a very, very hungry team and for us to
be able to perform the way we did was -- that's the best one we have had here
at my two years at A&M.  
You always look better when the shot goes in the basket. Made shots. I give a
great deal of credit to Colorado, but our guys played about as well as they
could today.  
_MODERATOR: Questions for our two student athletes._  
Q. You guys have a lot of Dallas area guys on your roster. Did you Dallas
guys get together beforehand, say we need to step it up here in our
hometown?  
ACIE LAW: No, it wasn't filling like that. We just wanted to continue to play
well. We felt like we have been playing well, playing with a lot of
confidence. We just wanted that to carry over into the tournament. Were able
to come out today and play well and get a good victory against a very good
team.  
Q. Was it the defense that got it started for you guys?  
ACIE LAW: Able to get stops. They missed a lot of easy shots that they
normally make and then we got a few shots to go down, Joe got going, just went
on from there. They never got going. We was able to get going. Ran away with
the victory.  
Q. What was your sense of urgency? You a big lead in the second half but
hard to play hard?  
ACIE LAW: We always, whole time we were out there on the court -- you want to
give your best effort. That's what Coach stresses to us. When you are out
there playing, give 110%. We always feel like the score is 0-0 no matter if
we're ahead or they are ahead. We continue to battle hard and don't pay
attention to the scoreboard. We did a good job. We had to play hard and get
stops and ran away with the victory.  
Q. How good does it feel to get that monkey off your back as far as not
winning a tournament game?  
ACIE LAW: Feels great. I mean, I am like speechless, just finally get a Big 12
tournament win it feels good. But we're here grateful to get that victory.
Still continuing to play, can't dwell on the victory. We play a really good
team tomorrow in Texas so we have to continue to play well.  
Q. You hit 3 point play, then on the next position hit another 3 going
against the shot clock. Did you feel those threes early were the turning point
for you all?  
ACIE LAW: Our goal coming out was to get stops. Take first open shot we could
get. Our main objective is get it into Joe. They did a good job of sagging in
the beginning and stretch their defense out, then Joe got going. Dominique, he
made a couple of big shots. Like I said, just made plays, got a big victory
today.  
Q. You were to be able score 21 points in only 29 minutes of play. I noticed
y'all had new shoes. Was it the shoes or what did you eat for breakfast?  
JOSEPH JONES: It wasn't the shoes. Just my teammates gave me the ball. I was
trying to do everything I could to give my team a low post presence. That's
what Coach stresses every game. I just tried to come in, give my team a great
low post presence.  
Q. What do you think about your next opponent? It's no strange face you will
be facing again?  
ACIE LAW: Texas is a great team. I know they are going to want to come in,
having a little extra motivation after what happened last week, that game last
week in the past. We have got to focus. Very talented team. It is going to be
a tough game for us to get a victory. Real good competitive game. We're both
going to come in and play hard. We'll see what happens.  
Q. Could you also chime in on the matchup tomorrow against Texas?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: I thought we had to finish with all the players first.
We have so much respect for them and we lucked out last week and, I mean, got
a magical win for us, we have so much respect for those guys. They have great
players, they got a great coach. Got a great program that's capable of winning
a Championship, the Championship this year, and we'll try to muster up enough
energy to try to be as competitive as we can.  
But we have so much respect for those guys and I don't know, I mean, we're
just going to try our hardest and see what happens.  
Q. Do you think Sunday is going to be a little less stressful now?  
ACIE LAW: I really don't know. We just want to continue to play well and just
try not to focus on NCAA last year. Major, major goal of ours, to get there,
but we still got games to play in this postseason tournament right now, the
Big 12. So we can't try to focus on NCAA, see what people are saying. We got
to maintain our focus on Texas and focus on that tomorrow and go out and get
another victory.  
Q. Talk about the impact Josh Carter had when he came in? Seemed like you
really got going?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: He was great. Acie made one of the better plays he made
all year by freezing the defender for Josh's second three down in the corner.
Josh really is a good shooter. He defended well today and he's turning into a
good defender and a rebounder as well.  
But those threes we were able to make in the first half definitely gave us a
great deal of confidence. We were able to work inside out, but we also got
some things in transition, especially the 3s, and get a little cushion there
and as we made those threes our confidence just continued to grow defensively,
and defensive rebounding even though they are hard time to defend rebounds
against. I guess I would add a lot words there, but Josh played great. Good to
see Josh. He's a Dallas guy too, and good to see him make those shots. If he
gets a shot, he can usually make it.  
Q. Talk about what you guys were to be able to do defensively against Roby
today? You had him frustrated pretty early?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: We tried our hardest and he's a great player. He's an
NBA player, and hopefully he will come back next year and play in our league
to make our league even better than it already will be.  
They do great job of running a lot of stuff for him, but we try to help as
much as possible and be there right on the catch and get your hand up on the
shot and we were just lucky to be able to be in a help position a lot of times
and contest most of his shots. Some days those shots go in and some days
don't. He got 18 shots up, we were just fortunate that more than he made went
in.  
Q. I know a lot of us in the media kind of had the sentiment that a win
today would put you in. Feel like this kinds of locks you in?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: Are you on the committee?  
Q. No.  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: No, I don't think this win locks everything up. I think
we have been in for a while and if you win a bunch of times in a row in a
major conference tournament, we're not bragging, not confused as to who --
we're a hard-nosed blue collar team and if you do what we have been able to do
at the end of conference, in the Big 12 Conference, I don't believe -- we
haven't -- our team has been great about that stuff. They haven't listened
when people say a lot of good things, they haven't listened when people say a
lot of bad things. What they do is they show up with their hard hat on every
single day. That's why they are continuing to get better. We have always
focused on the next practice, next practice to the next game. I really believe
that's why we're continuing to improve at this point.  
Q. Against Texas this year, Acie Law, there was a noticeable difference in
his stat line from Austin to College Station. He played much better at home.
What was the difference in play there that you hope would carry into
tomorrow?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: His stat line wasn't near good at home as it was at
Texas. He played much better at Texas than he did at our place or he scored a
lot more points and he made a lot higher percentage shots at our place. He
made a shot that they will never forget in College Station, and so it made it
look like he played a great game. He played a really good game, I am not
saying that. He probably played better against Texas the first time we played
him than he did the last time.  
Q. What was the difference?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: From -- what do you mean?  
Q. First game to the second game.  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: They do a great job defending. It's one of the better
defensive teams in the country and they are not going to give Acie anything.
They are not going to give any of our guys nothing. We're going try to do the
same with them. It is a team that can win the Championship and if you don't
play your absolute best you are in big trouble, and they played great man-to-
man defense, great zone defense, because they are so long. They are great
offensively inside, great offensively from the perimeter and best rebounding
team in the country so it's not easy to do anything against those guys.  
Q. Would you say that your team seems like it's kind of peaking right now at
the right time?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: I think I don't know -- I know for a fact we haven't
played better than this in two years than we did today against a real, real,
real, real good team. And I mean as far as everything working right, some days
we have played better defense, some days we have played better offense, but
today was one of those magical days where everything just seemed to go right
for us, shots went in, free throws went in, defended well. We could rebound
better, but it was a magical day.  
I do think that our team is getting better because they have taken the right
approach to the day-by-day practice and games, and I think all our teams that
I have been a part of, either as an assistant or whatever, I think that we
have always had that philosophy. We're a fundamentally based group, we're
going to spend a ton of our time on defense and rebounding. We're going to get
better and better as the season goes on. But we usually hit our stride right
around February and hopefully into March and try to play the best in the
conference to play the best conference tournament and then hopefully in the
postseason play.  
Q. How much do you think that it would mean to your players and this program
for a win tomorrow against a team as you say could win the National
Championship in a postseason setting and win the season series from them?  
COACH BILLY GILLISPIE: We're not into winning a season series or -- we're into
our next opponent which we have unbelievable respect for. It's very difficult
for anyone to beat the University of Texas. We got lucky last week in throwing
a shot at the end, but we don't -- our guys are really good about not worrying
about anything else except their next opponent.  
We don't worry about what we have done. Don't worry about what we haven't
done. We don't listen to a lot of people. Fortunately they listened to me
sometimes, and I listen to them all the time. But we have a real unique group
that just focuses on the task at hand and I really believe that's the reason
we have been able to improve.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [JamesOn Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13902)

### [Byron Eaton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15570)

### [Sean Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13714)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I was really proud of our team's effort second half the way
they fought back and got the lead and got us in position to have a chance to
beat a very good team. I think Kansas right now is legitimate Sweet 16 type
team, maybe further.  
But the two areas that have been a continuing problem all season long showed
up again tonight. We have been able to get our defense better down the
stretch, improved offensively, but the two areas where we have continued to
struggle turning the basketball over and scoring droughts, and both those
showed up at key times tonight. It happened in the first half for about a
10-minute stretch, then it happened once we pulled back up by one point. You
can't turn it over 22 times and shoot 38 percent and expect to beat a good
basketball team.  
Q. JamesOn, was that a war out there?  
JAMESON CURRY: Yeah, it was a war, man, tough game. Real aggressive and I
think both teams played real hard. We just came up on the short end of the
scoreboard.  
Q. What accounts for the scoring slumps during a ball games in your
opinion?  
JAMESON CURRY: Just taking care of the ball, getting a shot at it, you know.
It's all right when you have a scoring drought when you are missing shots, but
when you have a scoring drought you turn it over and you're wasting
possessions, and Coach is real critical at that, don't waste possessions. At
least you get a shot at it because if you shoot it, you get a shot at getting
a rebound, loose ball, anything of that matter. But if you don't get a shot,
you just turn the ball over, no shot at all.  
Q. JamesOn, you guys still haven't learned how to win close games, but looks
like you have really learned how to compete. Can you talk about your fighting
attitude in the last three and four weeks?  
JAMESON CURRY: Yeah. We got better as a whole team, became more unified and
showed a lot of confidence and grit. And some of those games we couldn't pull
out, but some of them we had pulled out at the end. It's just a learning
process.  
I think that we all agree it's been kind of a disappointing season, but we've
matured a little later than, say, Kansas, which was a young team also, matured
a little earlier than we did. But we matured a little later. I think if we was
playing this way about three, four weeks ago, we would have been in NCAA
tournament and we would be a dangerous team also  
Q. How much do you have to credit Kansas's defense for you guys to score
--  
JAMESON CURRY: Kansas is a great defensive team. Great all-around rebounding,
playing defense, offensive end, they forced some tough shots and have quick
hands.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: In my opinion they are the best defensive team that we have
played all year long. They gave us serious problems both times we played them.  
Q. This is going to put you in the NIT in all likelihood. You said it's a
disappointing season. Are you disappointed that you are going to be in the NIT
and what do you feel you can accomplish there?  
JAMESON CURRY: Ultimately little disappointed because beginning of the season
we had goals set to get in the NCAA tournament. But there's something always
positive out of it. You look at a team last year that won it, Memphis, and
this year they are going to be a one or two seed team in the NCAA tournament.  
So it's proving grounds for us as a team and going down there and getting
better and better and preparing for next year because I think we're bringing
back 95% of scoring, 99% of rebounding, some big number like that, so it's a
great opportunity for our team to go down there and get better and start
getting ready for next season.  
Q. How big of an issue is it and how much do you guys talk about trying to
get two more wins to get Eddie to number 800?  
JAMESON CURRY: I think it is very important. Coach Sutton had a great coaching
career, still has one, and that's a milestone that we would help like to be a
part of and help him reach it, and it is real important.  
BYRON EATON: I mean, just coming into the season that was one of our goals to
get Coach Sutton his 19 that he needed to get into the Hall of Fame. Hopefully
we still can get that goal this year if we make it to the NIT tournament, go
in there just play like we have been playing these past few weeks and get the
two wins for Coach and try to get the (indiscernible) to get into the NIT
Championship.  
Q. Did you enjoy the physical nature of the game? Did you think that gave
you guys an advantage?  
BYRON EATON: I say it was kind of -- it was like a -- we both had a lot of
fans here, I mean, just can't really say it was the fans that made the game go
like that.  
Q. (No microphone).  
BYRON EATON: No, I can't really say.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I think that's the way it should be, when these two teams
play. That's the way it's gone through the years, talking about two of the
most successful programs the last 15 years in college basketball, there's been
some great games through the years. And I said last night that the two games
last year were two of the best games I have ever been a part of.  
Q. How would you rank this game compared to those two last games?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Well, I think in terms of effort and defense probably
measured up. I don't think offensively either team played as well as the two
games last year. I think the game in Allen Fieldhouse was 81 to 79 and the
game in Kemper was 78 to 75. So probably wasn't as well played at the
offensive end, but just as well defensively. Just as much in terms of grit and
effort.  
Q. It seems like it's really difficult to prepare for Kansas defensively, to
prepare for as many long athletic bodies that they have. What makes them so
good defensively?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Well, really well drilled and well coached and -- but I
think the biggest thing, until you see them in person it's just how fast they
are and how active their hands are. First game they had 16 stills, tonight
they had 12. And just I think their overall team speed at every position
causes a lot of problems.  
Q. The final play there, happened right in front of you guys on the bench.
Your thoughts on whether or not you thought a foul should have been called,
then the free throw discrepancy, 3 to 1 for KU?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Well, you know, I can't answer on the last -- on the first
question. I thought Jamel -- and I am not sure the other player was -- a good
job of trying to prevent the ball from going inbounds and got themselves in
position and probably a judgment call.  
But in terms of free throws, they did a better job of getting the ball inside
and we have said all season long to our guys, the team that shoots the most
free throws is normally going to win. And they got there 30 times, we got
there 10. We had opportunities when the ball got inside and we didn't really
attack the basket like we should have. We settled for turnaround jump shots
and Kansas does a good job with their post defense. They really wall up and
get up right next to you and make you have to finish plays off over the top.
And it was a major factor in the game.  
Q. Obviously the NCAA is your ultimate goal. With the NIT forthcoming, is
this the kind of team that can use an NIT to gel, is that would be one of the
positives to that?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Well, one of the things that we really hoped would happen
with this year's team is that we would have a chance to go to the NCAA
tournament for the 9th time in a row. I think we have the 6th longest streak
in the country. To win 20 games for 9th straight year, I told them afterwards
that I am disappointed that it's not going to happen for you but at the same
time the NIT is an opportunity to play more basketball, it is a chance to
compete for a Championship, if you can win three games you get to go to New
York City and play in one of the great venues in all of sports and pointed out
the fact that Memphis last year won the NIT and has come back this season
probably going to be a number one seed.  
So I think with this team we would love to have the chance to play in the
NCAA. I just hoped that we get a chance to play in the NIT and keep playing
and keep improving.  
Q. JamesOn said that he thought maybe the Kansas -- you guys were both
young, they matured quicker than you guys did. Is that true and can you talk
about your maturity as the season has gone where you are at now?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I agree with that. They struggled out the gate early and I
think one time they were 3 and 4. And have won 20 of their last 24 games. I
felt the Kentucky game really gave them a lot of confidence the way they beat
them at Lawrence.  
They seemed to really start coming together. The three freshman, Chalmers,
Rush and Wright, have all made unbelievable improvement in my opinion and our
guys were just a little bit slower to mature. But I think in the last month we
have made really good progress and wish it would have happened earlier, but it
didn't.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Marcus Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15566)

### [Ricardo Patton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13705)

### [Richard Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13912)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_MODERATOR: Your thoughts on this afternoon's game._  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: First giving credit to Texas A&M. I thought they came in
and really played a fabulous basketball game. They were making shots all over
the floor. Certainly the outcome is not what we expected or desired, but I am
proud of our guys for where we're at at this point being 20-9.  
Q. Chris, with so much to play for today, where do you think things went
wrong and how do you think you guys let it become such a disaster?  
CHRIS COPELAND: A disaster. Guys weren't hitting. I think early on we came out
pretty hot and we got really cold, finished the game. Our defense could have
been a little bit more solid, a lot more solid, try to slow them down. They
got really hot from 3-point line. That really hurt us.  
Q. What are these next few days going to be like waiting for the NCAA
tournament bid to come out? I am assuming you will be on needles waiting for
that.  
RICHARD ROBY: Yeah, whoever goes to the tournament isn't determined in our
locker room, it is somebody else. So you just wait, you know, crazy things
could happen like a couple of years ago Colorado fourth in the Big 12, you
know, had 10 wins and didn't go to the tournament. So you never know what
could happen. We just got to sit back and wait and see what happens.  
_MODERATOR: We'll let you return to the locker room. Questions now for Coach._  
Q. Do you still feel like your team has a legitimate shot to go to the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: Certainly. I think I doubt virtually if one game will be
the cause if we don't go. I don't know that it will be because of this one
loss here today. But I still think that we're still a viable candidate to be
in the field of 64, yes.  
Q. What were your thoughts on the bench as you see your 10 seniors go out
with a performance like today?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: Well, you hurt for all the guys not just the seniors but
guys like Richard Roby, Calvin Williams who I thought came in and gave you as
little energy late in the game.  
You feel for all the guys, certainly that wasn't our plan as a staff. It
wasn't the plans as players. It was just one of those days where you have to
believe that you are never as bad as you look after a loss and sometimes you
are never as good as you look after a win. So we just have to regroup. I think
things are very positive for the program. It's moving in the right direction,
and I think there's still some basketball left for this team.  
Q. A couple of guys in the locker room said that you were going to leave it
up to the seniors if the NCAA doesn't work out leave it up to the seniors
whether or not they wanted to play in the NIT. Is that an option?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: No, we're going to play in whatever tournament is
available to us. I think to still be playing basketball in March regardless of
what tournament it's in, is an honor.  
Q. Can you talk about A &M and how different of a team that team seemed than
the team you have played few weeks ago?   
COACH RICARDO PATTON: The thing you learn from winning is how to win and they
are a very disciplined basketball team. I think if you look at the guys that
make big plays for them, they are guys that have been pretty consistent all
season long.  
We had one of those poor shooting nights tonight, if you think about we were 5
-- two of our better shooters from 5 from 29 from the field. It is very
difficult. That affects everything else that you do. When guys who normally
shoot the basketball well are struggling then it affects them on defense,
affects your rebounding. It has a negative effect on the entire team sometimes
because they are teammates, sometimes look to them to carry the scoring load,
and we just had an off day shooting the basketball.  
Q. How much did that early flurry of 3s when Carter came in affect your
team?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: Well, not just the early flurry but just the
continuation of making shots. I thought they made big shots all game long.
That's what good players do. They step up and make plays when they have to
make plays.  
Q. Shooting percentage was down, but did you feel like you were getting good
looks? Because it looked like to me like you were getting the shots that you
really wanted to take, a lot of the times?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: I thought so. I thought we got good looks. I thought we
did a nice job of attacking the paint and I know some of the shots that
Richard missed were right there at the basket and yeah we got good looks.
There were a couple of shots early on; particularly I remember a 3 that Roby
took that was in and out. It went down and came back out. So I thought we got
good looks most of the time. But also give credit to Texas A&M. They do a
really nice job of pressuring the ball and they are a solid defensive team.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Barry Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13707)

### [Jason Dourisseau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13914)

### [Jamel White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15568)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: I thought our team played really tough-minded and was a
hard-fought game and I thought it just kind of came down to some key plays.
But those key plays were sprinkled throughout the game really.  
We looked at so much in the last minute of these games, but there was effort
throughout. I thought our defense was different but it was good. And on the
night, I am just so proud of this team because they want to keep playing.  
Q. How does it feel to be the first Nebraska team to be in the Semifinals
since 1998?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: It feels great. I mean, we worked so hard for it and we have
been through a lot of adversity this year with our local media and everything.
It just feels great to get to this point, but we're not satisfied yet. That's
one thing we're going to talk about tonight, we have got another one tomorrow.
We're going to get ready to play.  
Q. Talk about the two freshman scoring the final 13 points of the game?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: That was huge. They grew up today. Marcus Walker and Jamel,
they have been playing good all year. This was a big game, on a big stage, and
they both stepped up huge when we needed them to.  
Q. What do you remember from the first two meetings with Kansas this year?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: First one was a nightmare. The second one, you know, we -- I
think the game was closer than the score indicated, but they made a lot of key
plays at key times in the game and they forced a lot of turnovers, so they are
a good team. They are young, but they are extremely talented and we have
another challenge ahead of us tomorrow.  
Q. Talk about coming in here losing some games and finding this, did you see
this coming at all? You guys have been struggling down the stretch. What was
it that kind of turned things around for you the last couple of days? Did you
see this at all during the losing streak?  
MARCUS WALKER: Yes, throughout the season we have been having a lot of ups and
downs. A lot of situations occurred in Lincoln. With coming into this game,
winning yesterday's game, gave us a lot of confidence. And with us being able
to beat them at Lincoln, gave us that extra confidence coming into this game.  
So I think everybody surrounding us in this circle knew we could win just
capitalizing on our mistakes and ran our offense right and make sure we do
what the little things that makes us win, like hustling, diving on balls and
getting rebounds.  
Q. Oklahoma has made of living out of winning 1-point games this year. But
you guys beat them earlier by one point. Did that game give you confidence
going into tonight?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: No doubt. We watched film from that game today at our meal
and we know what it takes to beat a team like that. You got to play tough, you
got to battle them on the glass. You got to battle them, possession, for
possession, especially on defense.  
Like I said, these two guys to my right, they stepped up and they made play
after play today. Our entire team, if you look up and down our roster, we have
guys stepping up, like Coach said, throughout the game. It was truly a team
effort today.  
Q. Can you talk about Michael Neal, the job you guys did on him, no shots in
the first half.  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: I thought that our guys' effort in this game on Neal was
a real key because we felt as their leading scorer in the Big 12 games this
season, that he was a difference maker and we wanted to try to limit the
number of shots that he got and certainly pressure the ones that he did.  
For him to have zero shots in the first half wasn't necessarily a requirement,
but it sure was a plus. In our -- in their defense or standing up for them, I
thought that they made good decisions not to force it down over to him and
make him shoot it or that type of thing and they had some other guys knocking
down 3s. I think three different guys scored 3-pointers in the first half. So
we had to pay for a little bit for the defense.  
But our problem in the first half was our offense in that that was a sure lot
better in the second.  
Q. You got a lot of defenses in your repertoire. Was it a little different
scheme? Did you guys just draw this one up for this game?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: Not really. It's one of the things we have used. Probably
use it again at some point so I don't really want to talk a whole lot about
it. But we played different defenses tonight. That wasn't the only defense as
well.  
Q. Talk about what this meant to you tonight, your coaches had a little
group hug there with about 4 seconds left, you could tell what it meant to
them. Talk about KU and the struggles you had with them this year, what it's
going to take this time?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: Well, I think that we're really excited at our team --
our team played hard throughout the game and made plays throughout the game.
Aleks really struggled early but he was a big help as the game went on. We had
so many other players got in this game and helped us, just the two freshman
had been gaining great experience this year and -- through necessity, but also
because of ability, they have been in ball games.  
As far as Kansas is concerned, Jason said -- I think he said the first game
was a nightmare, second game was at least a bad dream. They have had their way
with us and they have been a very good team. Had them all over my ballot for
post-season honors, and it is a tough, tough matchup. But it's a 40-minute
game and it is a new game so we'll certainly be here tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Mario Chalmers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13724)

### [Sasha Kaun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15569)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_MODERATOR: Congratulations on the victory tonight. Your thoughts on the
game._  
COACH BILL SELF: I thought it was two teams playing really hard. I thought
Oklahoma State played really tough and rebounded it and pressured us out of
what we wanted to do. We kind of did the same to them for a while.  
Good game. Good game. Not well played very artistic offensively, but I think
in large part due to pretty good defense.  
_MODERATOR: Questions._  
Q. It was odd that it comes down to a no call at the end because there were
no free throws really shot in the first half, then the second half it comes
back and there are a lot of free throws shot. Your thought there on the
controversial play --  
COACH BILL SELF: I am sorry, I didn't know there was a controversial play. We
had the ball out of bounds at 1.3 and I didn't know anything controversial --
two guys fell down. I don't believe for a second that it was a charge, but I
didn't know anything controversial occurred, so...  
Q. What is the status of the cut on the eye of Robinson?  
COACH BILL SELF: He got a good one. If he was a boxer, they would have called
the fight. I don't know how many he will need, but he's going to need several
tonight. But he's tough. Look at his line. I mean, didn't shoot it, but other
than that, that's 7 stills and 8 assists. He played tough and played well. I
am sure he will be fine for tomorrow.  
Q. What makes you guys so good consistently on the defensive end?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I think most teams we have had have been pretty good in
that area, but this team we tried to sell them so much on that we're going to
go through periods of time where we labor to score and we need to score off
our defense and make other peoples -- other teams play poorly offensively.
Mario and Hawkins and of course Russell, they can heat you up a lot of times,
can heat you up. But they don't have hands. These guys can heat you up and
they have great hands.  
Our bigs do a good job of not giving up easy baskets for the most part. Not
always, but tonight we defended them pretty good. 'Til the end, then they
reined in all those shots at the end.  
Q. Can you talk about the physical nature of the game with the bodies flying
and guys bleeding, things like that, what does that do for you when you win a
game like that?  
MARIO CHALMERS: That was very physical game tonight. We just tried to match
the intensity that they was bringing. That really helps us out. We get
prepared for the next game. When we head into the tournament, there's going to
be a lot of physical games. And that helped us prepare for it.  
Q. Mario, one of your coaches told us earlier in the season that your
defense wasn't quite as good. What was it for you to be named to the all-
defensive team and improve during the course of the season?  
MARIO CHALMERS: Good accomplishment for me. Coaches really helped me out with
my defense. I try pay more attention on defense and just tried to abide by the
rules and that made me better defensive player.  
Q. Did you feel the game was physical prior to the intentional foul or did
it get more physical after the intentional foul?  
COACH BILL SELF: I thought it was a physical game before the game started. I
mean right opening tip. I don't know that the intentional foul made it more
physical. I think it made the officials call more stuff after that. If I am
not -- I said to one of the guys, 15 minutes left in the first half, there was
I think one team foul called. We shot two free throws and they had shot one
for the game. Obviously, there's a lot of fouls called in the last 15 minutes,
coincidentally somewhat around that intentional foul call.  
Q. You have gone against your alma mater a lot now. Can you tell us about
the feelings of still going against them, especially what is happened with
Eddie and Shawn, all those things this year?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, it's not as emotional for me as it was before, but
there's no place, I mean, that's home, and I love OSU. I love Stillwater. We
had great years there and I certainly respect everything that the staff has
done in the wake of what has happened with Coach. And hopefully Coach is doing
better.  
But I think the teams in good hands. I think Sean has done a great job and I
think they are playing hard and they are playing to win and they are playing
unselfish and they are really guarding. And I think he deserves a ton of that
credit for them playing so well.  
Q. When you get ready to go to the NCAA tournament Hawkins missed a couple
of free throws late. Chalmer stepped up, he hit a couple. A particular guy you
want the ball in the hands of late in the NCAA tournament if you have got to
step to the free-throw line?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think statistically Mario is our best and Russell is our
second best and you know, Hawkins, I think Hawkins is a good free throw
shooter. I think he's shot six on the season now, so -- but we do have some --
I don't want to say weaknesses, but got some areas that we can improve in.  
For us to play well we're going to have to play certain guys and sometimes
those guys don't make free throws. That was pretty evident tonight as well.
Sasha and Julian I think combined to go 5 of 12. If we make our free throws --
although we shot 60, they shot 60. Although we shot a lot more. But if we make
our free throws, even them reining in those shots at the end, it wouldn't have
come down to the last possession if we made those free throws.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: After having been around here for Sunday's game, quite a
few times, I can honestly tell you it is a whole lot more fun to be here on
Sunday than it is to leave on Friday.  
But give all the credit to Nebraska. They are boxing one, and their zones
didn't allow to us get into a lot of flow. And when we did, we started making
shots and getting a little flow. When we weren't making baskets, I thought our
defense was pretty good. Then when we started making baskets, I didn't think
our defense was very good at all.  
This game, as I have said many, many, many times, it's a simple game, but we
have got to get back to putting both ends together at the same time. Sometimes
we play defense. Offense isn't very good. Sometimes our offense is pretty
good, then our defense isn't what it should be. We have got to find a way to
get back to playing both ends of the court. And getting off to better starts.  
I am still trying to figure out how to get us off to a better start. Last
four, five games, it seems like we're playing uphill too much. And eventually
that will get you. It got us tonight.  
Q. We were just talking yesterday about how great practices have been. You
felt like you had the best two practices of the entire season this week. Are
you shocked of the result now?  
KEVIN BOOKOUT: Yes, I am. The way we have been practicing really doesn't
emphasize on how we have been playing. The coaches have done an outstanding
job of getting us ready. It's just as players we need to take care of
business.  
Q. How are you going to do it? You have got perhaps one game left, unless --
I mean you are running out of time on your career, as is Terrell, so what do
you think -- is this perhaps the worst basketball you are playing this year or
have you been in these kinds of funks before that you think you can get out
of?  
KEVIN BOOKOUT: We can get out of it. It's just a matter getting our minds
right and doing it. We can't sit here and point fingers or nothing. We got to
take care of business.  
Next game, I mean, it could be me and Terrell and Taj's last game. So if you
don't get off to a good start, if you don't hit them out first, they are going
to be with you all game.  
Q. You guys have come out on the winning end of all these tight games here
down the stretch. What did you think tonight was the difference in another
tight one that didn't go your guys' way?  
KEVIN BOOKOUT: Just didn't make the plays at the end. Those four straight one-
point games they won, we always seem to come up with that loose ball or that
shot to win the game. This game right here it was their turn and they hit the
shot and they made the plays.  
Q. Terrell, the look in your eyes, are you more hurt, embarrassed, what are
your thoughts?  
TERRELL EVERETT: I can say I am hurt more because I really thought -- I agree
with Kevin on our practices and stuff. I thought we would just come out and
fight more tonight. I am just -- I don't know.  
Q. We hear the words "sense of urgency" a lot in sports. It seemed like
tonight it may be it wasn't there. Is that fair?   
KEVIN BOOKOUT: No, it is not, because this program, the Oklahoma basketball
program is built on playing hard and tough and competing every possession.
That's why I came here was the rough-and-tough attitude Coach Sampson brought
into this program. We got great program for us to come out here and lose in
the first round, that doesn't go well. We're supposed to win these games.
We're supposed to win the Big 12 tournament. That's how we play.  
Q. What do you think, Coach, did your team lack heart tonight? Or was it
just a bad -- I heard you talk about the one-half good and one facet and not
the other, but looked like in the second half no stops, they doubled their
point total, and you looked like you were going to upset by lack of effort;
true or false?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Well, I think that the boxing one and the zone has a
tendency to get you back on your heels. I don't know, it's just -- tonight was
a little bit of an ambush. I didn't see this coming. Texas game, you know,
30-something plus games you are going to lay in the egg occasionally. Texas
game -- but tonight was surprising. If we had played this game at 3 o'clock on
Monday or 3:30 on Monday or 4 o'clock on Wednesday, I just didn't see this one
coming, we're going to have to regroup.  
But you are right, if we can't find a way to get this turned around, you are
right, probably going to have one more game. But if we can get somehow carry
over from practice to the game, then this team is capable of getting the
tournament and winning.  
Q. A lot was made of the four-game winning streak with the one-point
victories over a quality opponent. Did those victory maybe mask the problems
that you guys have been having lately? Have you felt this team has been in
sync the last three, four weeks?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: No, you are probably right. I don't know that we have --
we had a stretch there where we played at Kansas, Baylor at home, at Oklahoma
State, can't remember who we played right before that or after, but we had a
stretch there where I just thought we were playing well.  
For this team to win at a high level like we have done a lot this year, we
have to be clicking. We don't have -- we're not as quick or as explosive or
athletic at the guard position, because you see tonight they were a little bit
quicker than we were. And then the junk defenses, they were running, you know,
we -- we found stuff that was working against it and was making shots. The
offense wasn't the problem. Problem was, like Bob said, we just weren't
getting any stops there in the second half.  
I mean, you have got to find ways to win with defense when -- we beat Oklahoma
State at home. We got down by 9. We didn't win the game because -- until we
were making shots, we were making stops. We just didn't do that tonight.
That's where we're a little bit confusing and confounding.  
Q. Because of the Texas game first and then this loss, how much damage was
done for the NCAA selection?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: We have to wait and see. You are asking a hypothetical
question. I don't have a hypothetical answer. If you ask me something more
specific I will answer it though, be glad to.  
Q. Your team started off the year leading the country in rebounding margin
in the last 8 to 10 games. Seems like you have out-rebounded more than you
have ever been since you have been coach at Oklahoma. Is that effort or
something else that's going on?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: That's hard to say. I mean if you look at the -- look at
the way we started tonight. We were down 7-0, then we come back and we're up 4
at halftime, so we have to out score them 11. Then we come out the second half
and you emphasize, you emphasize, talk about, talk about. But we have got to
get off to a great start these 4 minutes.  
We had games where we've been really good at the start of the game. We have
had games where we have been really good to start the second half. But looking
at the start of the first half and the start of the second half, obviously
there's something there that we have got to find a way to correct.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [A.J. Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15572)

### [LaMarcus Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14213)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH RICK BARNES: Obviously have a lot of respect for Texas Tech. And the
fact is that we felt like they would do what they did and force us in taking a
lot of perimeter shots. We felt like certain guys they would lay off of, being
very conscious of really trying to work around the basket area.  
I thought our guys did a good job of staying aggressive last couple of
minutes. We probably didn't make as good decisions as we need to be making in
that situation, but overall, when they made their run and got back in, we
stayed with it. Pushed it back out there and made some free throws at the end.  
I would probably be pretty happy with it. The fact that we only had 7
turnovers, good day there and the job we did on the board, I thought these two
guys -- Marcus was really terrific today, what he was able to get done down
low and stepping out doing a lot of different things he got really aggressive
on the offensive boards. A.J. missed some shots he normally makes, but I
thought his demeanor the way he came in was really important to us.  
Q. Talk about pretty much taking over second half, just your overall
performance going?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Just lately Coach would tell me just being more aggressive
and want the ball more. He tells me that he can't tell the guys just -- I have
to do it is with my body language. I was trying to be active today and keep
moving, looking for the ball.  
Q. Did you expect the game to be as close as it was? You beat this team
twice by 55 points. Do you remember the regular season obviously much closer
today?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Coming in, I think it was going be a close game, tough to beat a
team three times in one season. First two games they figured out our stuff for
this game. We knew personnel coming in. Playing for the third time, you always
know it is going to be a tough game.  
Q. Talk about playing in Dallas. How much did that inspire you today?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: It feels good to be back home. My mom is in the crowd,
brother and things of that sort. Just coming into this tournament, this is my
first Big 12 tournament so was just excited to be on the court and to be
playing right now.  
Q. Can you discuss about the possible or probable rematch tomorrow?  
A.J. ABRAMS: Any way it goes it's going to be a tough game, but if we happen
to get matched up with A&M, I think it will be a good game. I think we're
going to be very fired up for them. I think we didn't do some stuff well the
last game, coming off the next game I think we'll be more prepared.  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Just what A.J. said, we know we didn't play our best
performance, but A&M, they did play great, we watched film. We know what we
did wrong, just trying to build on that and just go out and just play hard.  
Q. Having a little trouble there early you got some offensive rebounds,
couldn't seem to get them down. A little nervous there or what was going on?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: No, just trying to get -- our coach said try and get quick
ups, whatever, so I want to give defense time to rotate over. I was trying to
catch them, put them as quick as I could. I wasn't really putting them in
right.  
Q. You seemed to be shooting from a little further out today. How far is
your range that you haven't showed us?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: (Laughs.) I mean, I am comfortable shooting to 17 foot, but
I never really will to up to now. I think Coach and I work on it all the time,
just shooting and driving to the basket and things of that sort. So I think I
am very comfortable out there.  
Q. Do you sense any lack of urgency in the fact that you already know you
are going to be in the NCAA tournament? Did you notice if that translates on
the court?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: No, I don't think we feel that way at all. Coach said this
is a whipping time and just because I think you think you are in the
tournament, anything can happen. We're not just trying to get in the
tournament, we're trying to win every game from now to the end of the
tournament. So I don't think anybody came out just thinking, oh, we're in the
tournament so we don't have to win. I think we're trying to win every game
from here 'til the end of March.  
A.J. ABRAMS: I think Coach put it well today. He said in a perfect world we
have -- we'll win 9 more games. If you can't get prepared for those nine games
and play hard, then you don't deserve. We're going to be prepared for every
game and work hard because we want to go out and get what we want.  
Q. You guys went a little lighter in practice to -- did you feel fresh legs
today especially with the way you guys dominated the boards?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: Yeah, I think just going light and taking some time off I
think I felt pretty good tonight. I am excited to just be playing right now.
So I think I will be all right because I never played a post-season or
whatever, so I think I will be all right.  
A.J. ABRAMS: I like a little light practice because we know what we have to
do. No reason to go and work hard this late in the season because it's all
mental now. That's how Coach puts it. If you don't have it mentally, then you
are not going to have it physically. So going out there, working on little
nitpicks in practice will help us more for the game.  
Q. As you are going through this, do you guys allow yourself to think about
the 1 seed and having that out there?  
LaMARCUS ALDRIDGE: I think it's always in the back of your minds. But I think
we're concentrating on one game at a time because you can't never really look
over anybody because anyone can beat you on any given night if you are not
focused or ready for the game. So I don't think we just think about that too
much right now.  
Q. I know this is looking way ahead, but if you could just indulge me I'd
appreciate it. Do you talk to your players at all about the potential history
they can make if they win the NCAA tournament and be the only major school, at
least as far as I know, that can hold baseball, football, and basketball
titles at the same time?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, I really don't have to talk about it because it's
been brought up in the media. Now they have to deal with it. I don't talk
about that with them. It's there. But I haven't addressed it directly to them
about that. I know they hear it because the questions are going to be asked.  
What I talk about 99.9% of the time is doing what we're supposed to do right
now. It's not about winning or losing. It's about going for it. It's about
playing every possession like it's your last. If you do that over the course
of the game, if you really do that, you are going to win, if you are a better
basketball team.  
We have goals when we start the season. Obviously we want to be the best
basketball team we can be. This team had set some goals but at that point of
it would be nice, but that's a long way away.  
Q. Can you talk about winning this game essentially without Brad because of
his foul trouble?  
COACH RICK BARNES: We can play a lot of different ways. Texas Tech is one of
the hardest teams you will ever have to defends man-to-man. They do such a
great job. And I have said before, Coach Knight is the best coach. I mean he's
unbelievable what he gets out of players, and not easy team to guard.  
Jarrius Jackson, I said it all year long, he's a terrific player, he single-
handedly can do some things. He got it going into in the second half, started
making some shots. I don't particularly like it when we go small, but the way
they were guarding us inside, we needed to have a post guy that was going to
work that mid-range area. And you know, P.J. gives as you guy that can do that
and you go back to the way they guarded us today. They were determined that we
weren't going to get the ball in there tight. They weren't going to force as
many jump shots as we wanted to take.  
On the other hand we want our guys taking those shots at the end I thought we
took a couple of quick shots that weren't good plays, but Brad never got
going. Just never got into the game because of the foul situation. The fact
that we won it played a couple different ways, you are going to have to have
that because who knows what is going to happen from game to game. For a good
basketball team you will find a way to work through some of those days.  
Q. Can you talk about LaMarcus's work ethic and how much does he actually
work on that? He was pushing it out a lot today?  
COACH RICK BARNES: First of all, he really can shoot college 3s. I don't think
-- that's one thing shooting them in practice and while practicing those
players, it's another thing in terms of having the confidence to do it in a
game. But he can shoot it. He's a very good shooter. We have actually tried to
talk to him about it all year long. Very first play of the game was designed
for him to shoot 15 foot jump shot because he spends a lot of time working on
it.  
LaMarcus hasn't even began to go where he's going to go. His mental makeup,
the whole thing, he has got a repertoire of things he's not yet knowing how to
use it all at the same time. That's his biggest -- other thing, we like to
give him the ball every time down the floor, he has got to want it quicker. He
was surrounded by Texas Tech team but he did a great job of he told me walk go
down the locker room tonight that he'd like to get 18 -- 20 rebounds tonight,
I said well if you remember you are going to have to go get it because they
are going to keep the body on you. I thought he did a great job on the
offensive boards spinning off going to get it.  
Q. What were some of things y'all talked about in that timeout --  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't remember, what time was that?  
Q. 12 or 13 minutes?  
COACH RICK BARNES: The thing about playing zone when you play it again, you
have to figure so that some point in time they were going to make some 3s. I
thought we got too conscious of the 3-point line, I thought it hurt us. You
have got to give Jarrius credit because he draws so much attention instead of
getting in the middle (inaudible) we locked into one of them, left the other
one open even though Tanner didn't have a good shooting day today, but it
happens this time of year, when a team makes a run we said stay aggressive,
try to get some stops, let us know where personnel is. This time of year it's
about personnel, knowing what you want to do, we just got stretched out too
much. We kind of tried to rotate more into a 3-2 looks as opposed to 2-3. That
was okay. Give them credit. They started knocking down some shots.  
Q. Did you see the kind of energy you were looking for the --  
COACH RICK BARNES: I think you come into a game like this, you as a coach, you
are always going to be concerned about a guy like P.J. Tucker, who has just
been named player of the year open, hoping that he doesn't do what he has done
during the year to get him there. It's tournament time, really you are not
sure how a guy is going to respond.  
In terms of our lightening up we have done that every time this time of year.
I think we have played more guys more minutes this year so I think that's
important. But we have been into a pretty good flow with practice but LaMarcus
can play all day long P.J. too, those guys can go out and play 40 minutes if
they had to go out. Other players need more recovery time. We would do it
regardless. This time of year is about being fresh mentally and physically,
and I thought our guys played again, other than the fact that at the end, when
we took a couple of quick shots when we should have been working the clock
better; missed some layups tonight, we had some good looks right around the
rim. I don't think we came in here thinking it was going to be easy. We had to
earn it, but we got it done.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Jarrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15060)

### [Bob Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15563)

### [Tanner Ogden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15562)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on your victory today over Kansas State. We'll
open it up for questions for our student athletes._  
Q. Tanner, it's nice to meet you. Can you tell us a little bit about your
game today and just, you know, how did it all come about, really quite a
performance for you?  
TANNER OGDEN: I was trying to come off the bench, give the team a spark. We
start off a little slow. Came down at the end of the half and just tried to
play well on defense and just not turn the ball over and just hit a couple of
shots.  
Q. Tanner, did you have any idea you were going to play this much? I noticed
you played a little bit more in the last couple of games, did you see this
coming?  
TANNER OGDEN: Before the game, Coach told me to get ready, so you never know.
So, some days, you know, he tells me to get ready and I don't ever come in.
You just always have to be prepared.  
Q. Jarrius, do you feel okay today? You looked like you were struggling with
your wind in the first half, the struggles had you early on?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: I think I had off day shooting, but we still got the win.
Still put it out at the end. But I am all right.  
Q. You happen to see who is scouting you for Texas today?  
TANNER OGDEN: My brother is back there in the back I saw him over there on the
sideline. During my warm-up he was making jokes at me or whatever, so, I saw
him over there.  
Q. Can you guys talk about facing Texas tomorrow and the challenges they
present?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: We think they present a very big challenge. I think it is a
very big opportunity for us. We just have to answer that opportunity.  
TANNER OGDEN: They are good team, one of the best teams in the nation. We just
have to come in there and play our game. Try to compete.  
Q. Jarrius, Tanner was saying that he came in trying to give the team a
spark. Did you feel like, you know, when he made a couple of three points,
took the ball in the basket, what kind of effect did you think he had on the
team?  
JARRIUS JACKSON: I think he came off the bench today, gave the team a very big
spark, him as well as the other players too that came off the bench today.
They just helped us out on the team on the floor and the bench. I think
everybody came out of the bench today gave us a spark.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys for coming._  
Q. Coach, talk about the impact Tanner had on this game. He said you told
him to be ready today, that's not always the case, doesn't always means he's
going to play but he did today?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I thought actually I told him to be ready when he was
getting off the bus because I thought this would be a really good opportunity
for us to use him today. He came in and really -- he made all the difference
in the world for us, with some plays -- he got really crucial rebounds. He
handled the ball well. It wasn't just the fact that he scored 14 points, but
did he an awfully good job for us today.  
Q. Talk about what -- you said you thought he might have a chance to have
impact today. Why is that? What did you see?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I watched him practice for three years. I have seen things
that he can do, and there are things that he can do were things that we might
very well needed to.  
Q. (Inaudible) he's averaged 6 minutes a game for the year. What it is that
you saw today that made him --  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: This isn't nuclear science. When he made a three, I left him
in a little longer. And then he hit another three and I said, goddam, I left
him in a little longer. Then he made a helluva drive and I said damn, stay in
there.  
Q. Talk about the prospects of facing Texas tomorrow and the challenge?  
COACH BOB KNIGHT: I haven't really thought about that.  
What I try to do simply here today was I have always thought that you start
out the season trying to win the National Championship. When that's eliminated
you are trying to go to the NCAA. You just -- always have a goal.  
Our goal today was simply that in the first four years we have been here we
have won at least one game in a tournament. Our goal was to win a game in the
tournament. And then see what we can do from there. So now we'll try and work
on what we have to do from there from the rest of the day.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Jimmy McKinney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13706)

### [Kevin Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14255)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH MELVIN WATKINS: I thought we got off to a little bit of a slow start.
Like our kids done at times, I knew they were fighting back and we did. We
fought back and made a game out of it, had a chance to win the game. I think
any time you play these type of games you want to be in the position to come
down the stretch to have a chance to.  
Q. Jimmy, there was a point end of first half where you just drove about
four, five times. One they took away, some you got points on. Last one you
wound up on your back grabbing your leg. What is going through your head there
at that point?  
JIMMY MCKINNEY: Well, Coach was telling you like we want to get some
transition, wanted to push the ball more and try to get back to the bucket.
That's what I did. I listened to Coach and like he's always right, I listen to
Coach, got the ball to the bucket and I thought he was up under the basket.  
Q. After the game on Sunday you talked about how Maric was the underrated
man in the Big 12. He had a similar performance as he did on Sunday.  
KEVIN YOUNG: The way their offense is set up, they really try get him down
low, and earlier he got a couple of breaks where he was down low and he really
got a couple of offensive rebounds that hurt.  
Q. How hard it is for you guys to process right now that the Big 12 is the
end of your season?  
JIMMY MCKINNEY: Yeah. It sunk in when the clock was ticking. But it's pretty
hard, especially for me. I know Coach is taking it pretty hard too. I think
competitor don't want to lose and just go out like we did is very
demoralizing, we're taking it as a man and it's really a growing process for
us just for the future  
Q. On selection Sunday are you going to watch the process?  
KEVIN YOUNG: I won't be watching, no. Probably be over at Coach Watkins' house
playing pool.  
THOMAS GARDNER: Selection Sunday really have nothing to do with us.  
Q. This has been a really breakout year for you. Frustrating way to end it?
How frustrating was tonight?  
THOMAS GARDNER: I think was frustrating just because I didn't feel my
performance was -- I didn't perform well enough for my team to win. 12 shots,
3 makes, I got to give credit to Nebraska defense. It was learning process.
Got a lot of room for improvement.  
This game was evident of that. As leader of the team I am more frustrated
because I put the loss upon my shoulders. With 50 seconds left I took a tough
3 -- don't think about that when you are playing. After the game I knew I
could have got to the basket. But I settled, and in the end it affected my
team.  
Q. Thomas, simply do you know where you are going from here? Any thoughts?  
THOMAS GARDNER: Not right now. My thoughts right now is just to spend as much
time as I can with Jimmy and Kevin before they graduate. My decision will come
later. Sitting here, talking to the people in my circle, finish school and
that's something that will take care of itself.  
Q. How hard is it to sit on the bench for the rest of the game?  
KEVIN YOUNG: It was tough, but it's tough when you are on the bench and the
guy come in for you and not really pull his weight. But I give Grimes credit.
I think he did a tremendous job. I think he fought and battled well and my
praises go to him. I think he did a real good job when I was out.  
Q. That wasn't how you envisioned your last game, was it?  
KEVIN YOUNG: Nobody envisions their last game like that. Big 12 you are
supposed to play physical, supposed to hit, supposed to wrestle with people,
and I was doing what I have always been doing and tonight the ref blew the
whistle on me. We got two big guys in the paints, of course they are going to
be battling. We're going to fight. I am just not going to let them get
position on me. I'd rather foul out going like that instead of having them
just catching and scoring all the time. I was just trying to battle with them.
I think he came in and did a really good job.  
Q. Being a senior leader on the team, what did you say to the team after the
game?  
JIMMY MCKINNEY: Well it was pretty tough, coaches did most of the talking. My
chance to talk to the guys and -- I just said listen to the -- really didn't
say anything. I am going to have my chance to talk to my teammates. They have
been great teammates through the whole process.  
It's difficult, but I look at this and our starting 5 was in foul trouble.
That's crazy.  
Q. Jamel White hurt you guys up in Lincoln. The shot he made with a second
or two on the shot clock, anything you changed defensively about that
possession?  
COACH MELVIN WATKINS: No, they were trying to attack us on the inside so we
had to collapse to give a little -- we had foul trouble, and that was part of
what we wanted to do, is collapse and try to get back to the shooters and of
course he had to hit it and he did, and give him credit for that. We thought
it was pretty good defensive possession.  
Q. You were obviously emotional when you took the podium here. What did you
say to your team after this was all over?  
COACH MELVIN WATKINS: I thanked them for the effort, all the things that we
have been through this year and under the circumstances I really wanted to
thank the team and hug them for allowing me to step in their lives a little
bit and they not quit and come to practice every day and give me the type of
effort and respect, that I really appreciated that.  
Then encouraged them to go back and be students. You can't just stop your
life. You got to move on and I expect our kids with great courage to do that.  
Q. Obviously such a rough year for Missouri. What do you think is the next
step that Missouri has to do to kind of bring things back?  
COACH MELVIN WATKINS: If you talk to me you are talking to me about I want to
be the head coach here, that would be the first thing. But above and beyond
that, got to get back and evaluate where you are, evaluate your talent, the
season, and look at where your needs are. If you got weaknesses in your
personnel, you go out and recruit and try to improve on those weakness.  
Q. Where do you go from here?  
COACH MELVIN WATKINS: Back to the hotel, get something to eat, visit with my
family a little bit and, you know, that kind of thing will all take care of
itself. Probably going on the road recruiting is what my plans are. I am going
to go and continue to work until someone tells me not to work anymore.  
Q. Would you have any objection with being an assistant coach again here at
Missouri?  
COACH MELVIN WATKINS: I really don't even want to answer that question right
now. Being the head coach or assistant, you know, I appreciate the question
but you got to understand what just happened to us out there. Our kids fought
their tails off and came up a little short and that's kind of the only thing
running through my head right now.  
I am sure as I get back and regroup a little bit, I can maybe answer that
question a little bit better. But right now, I am feel pain for my kids.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Dramane Diarra](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15564)

### [Cartier Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15565)

### [Jim Wooldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13703)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll come to you first for your thoughts on the game._  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: The offense, just looking at this stat sheet, kind of --
this is the first chance I've had to look at it -- just dried up on us. We
didn't make enough plays or obviously 1-and-12, 10 from 3-point range. 10 of
18 from the free-throw line. I thought we were getting the ball where we
wanted to get it and got to the free throw line, got I think a lot of shots
in-the-paint which was a big part of the game plan today.  
Then we couldn't stop without fouling them. Big possessions we gave away
defensively, I think we were capable of defending better but today Texas Tech
was too much for us.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for our two student athletes._  
Q. How disappointing is that to finish like this and talk about just your
general feelings right now about what is going on?  
CARTIER MARTIN: Right now, I mean, it's very disappointing, we was looking
forward to -- we wanted to keep playing. It's always hard when your season
comes to a stop because we all love the game so much that we want to keep
playing.  
DRAMANE DIARRA: Yeah, we expected much better than this from the whole season.
We came up short. It's a really big, big disappointment.  
Q. Was there anything Texas Tech did that surprised you guys at all?  
DRAMANE DIARRA: No, everything they did Coach talked about in the scouting
report. We didn't just execute well and make the right plays at the right
time.  
CARTIER MARTIN: We couldn't get stops down the stretch. We didn't get any
stops basically.  
Q. Talk about the lift that Tanner Ogden, who hadn't seen much action for
Tech this year, gave to them.  
CARTIER MARTIN: He stepped up and made some good plays for the team. He hit a
couple of outside shots that kind of got the momentum going towards them. He
stepped up and he did some good things.  
Q. Did you know anything about him, Tanner, did you guys know who he was?  
CARTIER MARTIN: No, I didn't really know him too much.  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: It was Number 31 that was making a lot of shots.
(Laughter).  
Q. Talk about what happened with you and Tim? You guys talked afterwards?  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: Well, not right now. I am sure he will visit with you
here sometime today and we'll let him -- as we talked yesterday, how it's his
call and we'll let him, the athletic director, make whatever announcement, you
know, that he's going to make.  
Q. You say it's his call, do you believe there's a call to make here?  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: I think there's an announcement that's going to be made.  
Q. Do you expect to be retained?  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: Look, he's going to make an announcement. I don't have
anything to say about it. That's what I said yesterday.  
Q. The players talked a little bit about it but can you talk about the
season as a whole, how disappointing it was for you?  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: Well, if you have heard me talk about, you know, our
team and our program and so forth, you know, I have used the word
disappointing at times about you know, a game or two, but I must say that, you
know -- I hate to use that word right now.  
Our basketball team showed some life. In this business, you can't say, you
know, close, and use that as a parameter as to who you are, but it was really
that kind of season. It was a close season.  
I would use that word probably more so than disappointing because you know
those kids are going to play again. Hopefully they will have the frame of mind
that they can have positive frame of minds, they can take from what they
accomplished this year and use it in a constructive way a year from now.
Close, not disappointing.  
Q. When you look at this season being as close, what do you think it was
that kept you guys from not quite -- so many games that you could have won
that you didn't quite win, what do you think was the difference this year?  
COACH JIM WOOLDRIDGE: Well, that's the million-dollar question, and you guys
have been around every game, I just hate to say this redundantly all the time,
it's a play, it's a defensive play, it's a free throw that we have got to
make. It's a three-point shot or a field goal that we just have to jump up and
make, kind of like today.  
Now how many good shots did we have? We had a lot of good shots. I know the
game today is not the hot topic today, but we had 19 offensive rebounds. We
had 17 assists, 13 turnovers. Those are healthy numbers. And you know, it's --
today it was the fact that, you know, we had some defensive lapses and we
missed some layups and we missed some free throws. The free throw is
quote/unquote free throw. And whether you -- in the middle of the game or at
the end of a game, you know, a field goal -- you know, I am sure and I am not
-- I just think our team -- we had to stay on balance all the time in every
phase, you know, from start to finish because we weren't a great team.  
But we were a good team and we could beat a lot of people. But it had to stay
on balance from beginning to end. Just that one play that we had to continue
to make we couldn't make it. I wish there was a better way to explain it.
Maybe you guys know better than me, but that's how I would say.

### [Chris Copeland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13710)

### [Marcus Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15566)

### [Ricardo Patton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13705)

### [Richard Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13912)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the Colorado Buffaloes following their
victory over Baylor. We'll go to Coach Ricardo Patton for his thoughts on
today's victory._  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: I thought it was a great game. Hopefully all the fans
got their money's worth.  
We knew Baylor was a different basketball team than the one we faced early in
conference play, and they played extremely well. So hats off to them.  
But I thought our guys did a nice job of sticking with our game plan and
coming through in the end. Certainly, making free throws down the stretch paid
big dividends for us.  
Q. Rich, you didn't get your first field goal until late in the second half
there. What was happening with you today?  
RICHARD ROBY: I just couldn't get in rhythm. I didn't really want to force
anything. I was trying to have the game come to me. But at the end I had to
find a way to put the ball in the basket because I knew my team needed me to
score.  
Q. Did you feel okay? Because I know you had a cold you were struggling a
bit?  
RICHARD ROBY: No, I am fine. You have got play through sickness, that's what I
am going to do.  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: I thought the cold affected his defense more than his
offense (laughter).  
RICHARD ROBY: Not funny. (Laughter).  
Q. Talk about the importance of tomorrow's game against A &M?   
MARCUS HALL: We understand that we need to win as many games as we can win in
this tournament to try to control our own destiny, which is get into the NCAA
tournament. We'll take it just as we need to. We knew we had to win today.
Tomorrow's game is the next game which is the most important game.  
Q. You guys get the victory but can you talk about the effort that Baylor
put forth as the 12 seed?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: We knew coming into the game that Baylor was going to
put forth a great effort. They are well coached. They have really solid
players, young players, Baylor is going to be a team to be reckoned with in
the future in this league.  
Q. Talk about the drought you went through there to open the second half.  
RICHARD ROBY: I thought getting good looks at the basket. Shots wasn't
falling, we had to depend on our defense. We tried to translate our defense
into offense and tried to get easy buckets. They were making shots and that's
hard to do, but that's where the defense has to come in and grind your way
through it.  
Q. Do you feel like pressing a little bit -- did you feel like you started
pressing a little bit during that time?  
MARCUS HALL: No, I mean, we have -- obviously we have shown ability to come
back from slow starts or given up runs, this is not the first time we have
been through a 10-0 run or 15-0 run. I think that's where the maturity of our
team comes in, kept our cool, kept our heads and just fought it out.  
Q. Is it safe to say you guys kind of have a feeling of relief right now
getting through this game?  
CHRIS COPELAND: Yeah, I guess you can say. That Baylor came out, played us
really hard. And any time you get a victory against a team that plays that
hard, it's always a good feeling when you get the win.  
Q. When Chris fouled out I think it might have been the first time he fouled
out this year, what was going through your minds, you lose one of your scoring
options?  
RICHARD ROBY: I didn't even know he fouled up. I just found out right now.  
MARCUS HALL: I kind of took it as a little more incentive to look to score. We
had guys out there the whole game just hitting key shots and big buckets. Me
and Rich couldn't get into a good groove.  
I think the most important thing is we won the game without shooting the ball
well, so, I mean, that's what -- that's a good feeling for us.  
Q. How do you feel like you guys match up with A &M? The guy down there
ended a lot of weird stuff toward the end of that game. What do you guys
remember from that game?   
RICHARD ROBY: I think we played well. We started off slow. What was it,
14-to-0 throughout the game? We can't do that again. We have got to start the
game well. I think we match up well with them. I think we did a great job
guarding Joseph Jones up there. We know they are going to come out and play
defense. That's the mindset of their team.  
Q. Isn't it true, though, that that game is kind of stuck with you guys? I
mean you guys were upset about the way it ended, is that not true?  
RICHARD ROBY: I would say it is. We definitely wanted a second shot at them.
We felt we should have won that game. Some stuff happened at the end, but we
still had a chance to win the ballgame and we didn't. That's one of the road
games we felt we should have won. We're looking forward to playing them again  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys._  
Q. Ricardo, what were you thinking during that 0-for-12 drought that you
guys started the second half?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: My assistant has a great term for that. It's like
fishing, you know, just throw your line in over here and see if you get a
bite. Then you throw it in over there see if someone is biting. We have enough
guys I think that we can throw guys in and hopefully get a spark. I thought
Eddy was one of those guys today. I thought Glean Eddy did some nice things
made some free throws when he had to. But this team has always, I think all
season long showed the ability to come back and have a run when we have been
down.  
Q. How important is tomorrow's game going to be for your team's tournament
chances?  
COACH RICARDO PATTON: I am not sure. I think -- I would be shocked we weren't
already getting serious consideration for the NCAA tournament. This is a very
tough conference. I think this team has done a nice job so far. That's out of
our control at this point. So we're just going to focus in on -- just do the
best that we can do and focus on A&M. I think that this team has shown that it
is worth thief an NCAA bid. That's just my personal opinion.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Barry Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13707)

### [Jason Dourisseau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13914)

### [Jamel White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15568)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
_MODERATOR: Coach, we'll come to you first for your thoughts on tonight's
victory._  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: I thought our team got off to an okay start in this game
and we had a good first half working, but Missouri was not going to back down
and they made a push there. We fouled them and started missing free throws.
That was really a big part of our problem.  
In the second half, we stretched it out to I think a dozen or so again and
really weren't able to finish with some scoring at that point and they really
took it to the basket on us. We had some trouble stopping them and then some
great individual plays were made at the end of the game. Jamel's three-pointer
was a huge basket and then we finally got some stops in the first few
possessions.  
Q. What about Oklahoma? You guys played them earlier this year? Jason, this
goes to you. You won that game by a point, what do you think about the matchup
with them?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: That's a tough, well-coached team. We're going to have to
come out and obviously give a lot of effort. But we got to show a little bit
more toughness than we did tonight as far as free throws and some turnovers.
Just, you know, letting the ball go through our hands and things of that
nature. We're going to have to try and win the battle on the glass as well
because they are a great offensive rebounding team and they got one of the
best front lines not only in our conference but probably in America.  
It's going to be a tough game. We're going to get rested up and be ready for
them.  
Q. On Sunday in Columbia you kind of took that loss on your shoulders
because the weight-guard, in other words, went off. What was your attitude
heading down the stretch in relationship to that?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: To be honest with you, some of those threes he shot tonight
at the end of game there wasn't much difference. The only difference was the
result. I had a hand up on Sunday as well as tonight and they didn't go in
fortunately tonight.  
But a player of his caliber, like I say, he's capable of going off at any time
and, you know, we're fully aware of that. I just try to stay on him as much as
possible and chase him as hard as I could. Fortunately he wasn't knocking down
as many shots tonight.  
Q. Do you find it a little ironic that on Sunday your coach said you guys
fell in love with the jump shot at the end of the game and tonight you are
left with a decision whether to take one or not? Talk about what was going
through your mind at that point?  
JAMEL WHITE: Well, the shot clock was going down a little bit. My teammates
just found me at the right place. It was a good shot.  
Q. Jason, was this last dunk powered by a senior who didn't want to finish
this thing tonight?  
JASON DOURISSEAU: I figured -- it's part of that, but figured if I didn't try
to dunk that I probably would have got it blocked. They weren't calling many
fouls down there. I just went aggressive. Aleks made a great play to get that
rebounds. He found me, they were scrambling, I had a hand at the basket, I
just took it. I was going to try and dunk that to matter what.  
Q. What are you feeling right now? This is something new at the Big 12
tournament.  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: I am hoping that we don't have many questions so we can
go practice free throws right now because I think that about gave the game
away. I feel really good about our team because they want to keep playing
basketball. There's four days here for us as we finished in the 6 spot and I
thought that our focus was really good. We had got out to a 12-point lead in
that first half with just four to go, stumbled there at the end of the first
half. And then again, I thought we started well again in the second half and
pushed out to a good lead.  
But Missouri didn't stop. It was a tough ballgame for both teams, I think.  
Q. If could you also talk about tomorrow night's matchup against Oklahoma?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: It's been a while since we played them given that was the
opener of the Big 12 season. So we have certainly watched them play and push
themselves right to the brink of being in the Championship position. But the
thing for us is to try to duplicate the things we have been capable of doing
this season.  
Talked to our team before our game about those kind of thoughts and focusing
on making similar plays that have already been made. With Oklahoma, they have
got an excellent team. They really didn't -- they were without one of their
key guys who has played very well for them, when we played, and but they --
you can always start with Gray and Bookout and Everett, so they are obviously
a very good team to finish third in our league.  
Q. That shot clock run down a little too close for comfort when ended with
White's long three-pointer?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: Really we were trying to milk as much clock as we could
late in the game and working with the penetration and trying to attack and
maybe draw some help defense and find an open teammate. That's kind of a basic
in basketball.  
But we're not -- we don't have a specific time other than before that, that
sucker buzzes, so it was fortunate.  
Q. Speaking of free throws, 50% from the line tonight. Anything you can
attribute to that poor shooting? Is it just a lack of concentration?  
COACH BARRY COLLIER: I don't know that -- we had a couple of guys there that
don't get a lot of opportunities in the first half that missed and then Alex
missed a couple early. Sometimes free throws seem to work like that, they
think more about it than they should at the free-throw line, but I don't think
that anybody has -- we're close to a 70% free throw shooting team for the
season and yet tonight it just about cost us the game, so -- I don't think
that will happen again and I hope we get fouled as much because going to the
free-throw line is normally a very good thing.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Aaron Bruce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13911)

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Curtis Jerrells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16448)

### [Tommy Swanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14305)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
COACH SCOTT DREW: From our coaching staff point of view, so pleased with what
this team has been able to accomplish. There's nobody ever been put in a
situation we were put in and just very proud of how our team handled it, how
they have been able to overcome adversity. It's something that will happen the
rest of their life.  
Obviously we wish we would have won the game and want to thank everyone in
Dallas, the hospitality has been great, and I wish we were here to enjoy with
you a little bit longer.  
Q. Curtis, defensive job on Richard Roby obviously very good job today. What
did you see about his techniques or what did you try to concentrate on as far
as taking away his shot?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: He's incredible player, as everybody knows. I just tried my
best to limit his touches, just tried not to let him touch the ball because if
he doesn't have it he can't do anything with it. I tried my best all night and
he did a great job, knocked down a big shot at a crucial time.  
Q. What are your thoughts about the season coming to a close? Is it
bittersweet? Are you happy? Is it upsetting?  
AARON BRUCE: We're happy with that fight. It's always tough to say that you
are happy when you lose a game especially in a tournament, but we have shown a
lot of progress and we can see that by us being in position to win games. Once
again tonight we had a good lead. As part of growing in this league, learn how
to hold off teams, extend leads and really kill teams when we have the
opportunity.  
Q. Talk about how difficult it was not having the guys who fouled out in
there at the end?  
AARON BRUCE: They fouled out because our fighting so hard all night. They did
a great job. It definitely hurt us, made us a lot smaller, so that's sort of
when Colorado started to capitalize on the boards a little bit more.  
Q. I guess the next to last possession down by 3. What were you all trying
to set up? Anything in particular? I believe it was 62-59?  
AARON BRUCE: We had the ball at the side. We have a little landing, ran a
little duck in trying get a quick 3. They ended up switching, which they
hadn't done the whole game. We ended up getting the ball and trying to -- I
think Tim got a good look, doubled again on me and Tim got a good look.  
Q. Is it sad to see your career come to a close to -- I know you hoped you
could play four games.  
TOMMY SWANSON: Kind of disappointing to lose in this tournament. But I mean to
me the way we played and fought to the end, I can't ask for anything else from
myself and my teammates. Especially the time I had with them and the team has
much promise.  
Q. Talk about the progress this program has made all season long and maybe
today's game, chance to show that next year the --  
CURTIS JERRELLS: We just spend a lot of time at the gym. We know that coming
in here we were the underdogs, probably by 20, 30 points. We just got a lot of
negative talk about us and we all got together and we stay in the gym a lot,
even after the practice hours. And we had a ton of practices before our season
even started. So we motivate each other. We go out an compete against each
other in practice. We don't want to cheat each other.  
Q. If you had to kind of maybe predict, what do you think this team would do
next year with a full season?  
AARON BRUCE: That's hard to predict too far into the future because we're
going to have a lot of new great recruits coming, we have a lot of outstanding
players, outstanding freshman coming in, so just have to work hard
individually in the off-season and then come practice time next time this year
-- next year, reevaluate ourselves and start the whole process again, gel
together as a team.  
Q. A lot of people mention you when they talk about your team. How excited
does that have you for next season? What are your prospects for next year?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Hard to think about next year when you just lose, but I know
that our team has improved tremendously from the beginning of the year, you
look at Texas Tech we lose by 18 then we beat them by double digits, play
Oklahoma State, lose home by 18 then have a chance to win that game on the
road. Lose by 33 at Colorado have a chance to win today. I think we have made
tremendous progress. The big thing when you are building a program you have
got to be competitive. We have reached that point you have got win your home
games of the I think we did that at the end of year. Now next step is just to
be more consistent.  
Q. Talk about the defensive job Jerrells did today and those of us who
didn't see the game -- did you all attack Roby differently today?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: We weren't the same team as we were up there, just I mean
that should have been our first game -- completely different team. Curtis, one
thing that everyone knows, he can score, but he's our best perimeter defender,
and that's the great value that Curtis Jerrells, he helps you on both ends,
and it takes a team effort to slow down Roby, you don't ever stop him. He hit
the big three, contested three. In games like this it comes down to who makes
the big shot. He hit a big shot. We hit a couple of big shots to get us there
down the stretch, but it didn't.  
Q. I know the season is just over but perhaps you have thought about this
before, what did you learn from this season that you think will carry over
that you can use in coming seasons?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I hope no one has to endure a season like we had to endure
because it's a lot tougher than people would ever realize. You are so excited
to play and then you find out you are not close to being ready. Hopefully it
is a deterrent from keeping people in our situation.  
Second, I think our team learned how to win, how to be competitive. I think
that bodes well, just like Colorado last year I believe they won 4 games in
their conference and now they are top 25 as of what, two weeks ago? So
hopefully we can now take that a step forward.  
Q. How much do you think Colorado has come back down the stretch?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: You can't replace experience. 10 seniors, in a situation
they don't want it to be their last game and play for an NCAA tournament
berth. The good thing is we will have that experience in a couple of years.

### [Carl Krauser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13743)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Coach Jamie Dixon, Carl Krauser, Aaron Gray._  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: First off, congratulations to Syracuse and the win. They
played well. It was a great game. Two great teams going at it. A great BIG
EAST final for us. At this point, obviously disappointed for us, but
congratulations to them and how they played and how they performed. They
should be very proud of their team and their players.  
I'm especially proud of my players and how we battled back, played through
some things and put ourselves in a good position at the end of the game.  
But came up a little bit short, but I'm so proud of how we battled. This was a
good week for us. We got better. We're going to build off of this.  
Thank you.  
Q. The fact that you were able to take the lead with eight and a half to go,
came right off the time-out, Gerry hit the three, did that pop the balloon on
you guys?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, that's what's going to happen with good teams
playing. It's going to be -- you know, we were down, got good shots right
after that, we had a transition, couple opportunities, came up a little bit
short, went to the basket a couple times. So, I mean, it was just they made
some shots. I thought they shot the ball well tonight. I thought we could have
shot it better, but, you know, we played well. I thought we did a good job
getting good shots all the way through, and around the basket we got the ball
inside like we wanted to do.  
So it was just a good game that came down to a couple of close plays at the
end, which we kind of thought it would going into it.  
Q. Carl, did you feel like you got fouled on that pump fake with about 25
seconds left?  
CARL KRAUSER: Not to be disrespectful, but I don't think it really matters at
this point what I thought because obviously the refs didn't think that. I was
just trying to draw a foul and get a shot, or else I could get to the line and
make three shots. But the foul wasn't called, and we just had to continue to
play and just find a way to win.  
Q. You talked about controlling the boards, rebounding in the games you won.
It was a standoff tonight. Was that key tonight?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, it was. We felt we had to win the battle. We lost by
one. That's a big key for us. We got up at half time and didn't finish it off
in the second half.  
But, you know, a lot of things come into it. Our guys played hard. They
battled all the way through. We got after it, some long rebounds, some balls
that went out of bounds. Those things, that's a big goal for us and one of the
things we want to do and we came up a little bit short. But it wasn't for lack
of effort. It wasn't for intensity, the guys were getting after it. Sometimes
we just got to do it the same way, do it again next game.  
Q. Carl, I know you're disappointed, obviously. But as a competitor, do you
appreciate what Gerry did this week?  
CARL KRAUSER: I could definitely appreciate that, you know. He's a great
player, he's a competitor also. Our respect goes past basketball. You know, we
respect each other as people.  
I'm happy for him, you know. He battled. He quieted all the naysayers, and he
made a tough shot and he led his team the way he was supposed to.  
Congratulations, Syracuse.  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on Syracuse coming into this tournament and your
thoughts on Syracuse now.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Well, you know, I didn't see too many differences. I mean,
they made some shots tonight, from the previous time we played them, two-three
zones. It was the same things. I thought their big guys finished plays well
tonight. Did a good job in some areas. The rebounding was there but that had
something to do with us missing some shots, too.  
They're a good team. They've had -- I look at their schedule and our
conference, you see who they played and who they lost to, I mean, they lost to
good people. I think maybe they got some bounces tonight that they didn't get
maybe in the preseason, in the conference season, I should say.  
So, you know, I mean, they won four close games and ended up losing some. In
my minds, they were an NCAA team coming into this team and they're definitely,
everybody knows now, an NCAA team.  
Q. You guys weren't expected to get to this point. How will this run you
made bolster you going into the NCAAs?  
AARON GRAY: We learned a lot from this week. Even as disappointed as we are as
a team, you know, from just tonight's effort, you know, we definitely learned
so much. One of the biggest things we can take away from tonight is we got to
bring it every night.  
We started off real slow, and the guys did a great job of playing so hard and
coming back. Our team was almost, like, determined at one point. We just
didn't make the final plays to come down the stretch. But, I mean, there's so
many positives that we can take out of this week. We're real confident going
into the NCAA tournament. I mean, we've beaten really good teams the last
three nights, you know. To come up short to another very good team, you know,
like I said, it's all positive at this point going into the NCAA tournament.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about adjustments you made. They were defending high
post real well. You made adjustments. The zone looked more intense out
there.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, you know, we didn't shoot it great tonight. That
has a lot to do with the zone. I thought we got the ball inside when we wanted
to. I think second half we got a little bit -- used shot fakes around the
basket, got some finishes too, as well. I thought we did a good job attacking.
I don't think it was any different than what we've seen in the past against
them. We've always been pretty good against the zone.  
I thought our defense, they shot the ball well. It's, again, it was close. We
want to really overanalyze this thing, it was a close game coming down to one
or two plays. Don't read too much into it. Two teams battles, two teams
playing hard, and came up a little bit short on a shot or two and a rebound or
two or deflection. It's two teams that battled and played their hearts out.  
Q. Aaron, in the second half, did you do a better job of finding the soft
spots in the zone?  
AARON GRAY: We came out real tentative, you know. They got great shot-blockers
in the middle. The best way to attack a shot-blocker is go right at him and we
weren't doing that. That was allowing us to get our shot blocked. Obviously,
we changed that.  
You know, we were going right at them, drawing contact. You know, the ball was
fortunate to go in sometimes.  
Also, you know, I thought our rotation was a lot better so we had the defense
kind of guessing where the ball was going to go instead of in the first half,
you know, they kind of knew where it was going to be. They could set
themselves up to block the shot. The guards did a great job, and they found us
real well, you know, put us in a position where we wanted to be. You know,
things started to drop for us.  
Q. Is this tournament indicative of how fine a line there is between winning
and losing? One shot doesn't go in for Syracuse, they're in the NIT next week.
Talk about the appreciation you have for that fine line as a coach.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I think I said from the beginning of this tournament that
the seedings and how teams ended up in this season, you really can't, as much
as any league in history, when you have teams that aren't playing once and
when they're playing at home, so many good teams, so many teams, that where
you end up, you have a good game every night, a tough team every night, you're
going to have close games every single night and things are going to happen.
This is a team Syracuse, I think were 7 and 9 in conference, and they won four
close games in this tournament.  
So it's, it's what it was. I mean, this was a reflection of the whole
conference season. Ended up here tonight, as well as the last four nights.  
Q. There's a lot of talk about you guys, both teams had to play four nights
in a row. Does fatigue become a factor? How do you work around it?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I'm sure these guys would like to play tomorrow night. I
don't think it does. I mean, I think that gets overrated. I said it before the
game, before the tournament started, I wasn't too worried about not having a
bye in the first round. I wasn't concerned.  
We kept our guys fresh going into this tournament, knowing what we had to
face. We -- wasn't really surprised. I knew we'd battled. We battled again
tonight.  
Q. Carl, as much as this building means to you, having grown up in the area,
I imagine it's pretty disappointing after a loss. Can you be bolstered at all
by the fact that you at least made this run and got here?  
CARL KRAUSER: I'm not satisfied. I'm never satisfied to get all the way to the
championship and lose, you know.  
I'm a tough competitor and everybody on my team is a tough competitor, as well
as the coaches. We're not satisfied, you know.  
But at the same time, like you said, we have a lot to learn from this and
we're going to take a lot of positive out of this and we're going to get ready
for the tournament, you know. We're going to get ready for Selection Sunday
and find out who we play, get in good preparation, just rest our bodies and
get ready to go to work.  
Q. Carl, are you going to walk out of this thinking you should have won this
game?  
CARL KRAUSER: (Laughing). Yeah. Yeah, we'll walk out of here thinking, "We
should have won this game," of course.  
Q. Why?  
CARL KRAUSER: Because, you know, I feel that we're tough competitors, you
know. Everything just felt right at the same time coming into the second half.
We had the momentum and everything like that. Both teams are great, great
competitive teams in the BIG EAST. I just always tip my hat to the other team
and Syracuse did a great job.  
Q. Coach, when you guys took the lead, McNamara hit the three right away.
After the time-out, you got four or five stops in a row. Did you say anything
special?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I thought our defense got better. Like you said, we did
what we wanted to do defensively. We had a couple transition attempts that we
had, a good look to the basket. You know, we put ourselves in a position. We
just came up a little bit short on a couple shots, open looks, free throw. I
mean, it was, you know -- it comes down, it's a fine line, as we know. I
thought we put ourselves -- that was probably the best -- I'm glad you brought
that up. I thought that was the thing we were most proud of, when we really
had to lock it down defensively, we did at that point. We got steals and
really took them out of some of the things they were trying to do and they
didn't get really good shots. That was a big part.  
I don't think Carl has ever been in a game that he didn't think we were going
to win, going back to what you said earlier.  
Q. "Should have won."   
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Same one with that one, too.  
Q. Coach, what are your expectations going into tomorrow?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: As far as...?  
Q. Just as far as how you think things are going to play out with the BIG
EAST in general, and even just with your team after such a close game
tonight.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I think we should have nine teams in the NCAA tournament. I
think we should set a record. I think our conference, we talked about how
great this conference was going into this season. And the conference, just
like our guys tonight stepped up, our conference stepped up. We deserve nine
bids. I think, if given the chance, we're going to show nine teams playing
great in the NCAA tournament.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Both teams gave everything they had tonight. I thought for
the fourth game in four days, the quality of play was tremendous. I think, you
know, the last few plays that both teams made, there was just a lot of tired
plays that guys just couldn't finish. You had to understand that that could
happen.  
But this team showed more heart and guts than any team I've ever coached.
Gerry had as good a four days here as anybody that I've ever seen since I've
been coming here. He just wanted to win.  
We really played great early, got control of the game early. Demetris was
huge. Our big guys really played well. We played as well early as we can play.
I knew Pittsburgh was going to come back. They were getting inside. We were
blocking a lot early. Sooner or later we're just going to run out of gas, not
be able to block all those and they're going to be able to get some inside
plays.  
We had just enough kind of to hang on. Eric struggled, but he's a gamer. He
made that shot. Try to screw it up by trying to draw a charge, whatever he was
trying to do there, I'm not sure, but that's sometimes what he does, sometimes
he gets a little bit exuberant.  
But for Josh Wright, he hadn't played, he is a good free-throw shooter, that's
why we put him in that situation. He's quick to the ball. But for him to make
all four, and we needed all four, we needed the first two for sure because
Krauser is going to go down and make that three, you know, but to make all
four, I mean, that's a lot of - a lot of - guts, to make those four free
throws. I'm not sure Gerry would have, as tired as Gerry was. He probably
would have found a way, too.  
But these four games, probably the best of anything I've ever been around and
certainly in this tournament we've been fortunate to play well here and win
some tournaments here. But it's always been three games and there's always
been an easy game in there. To have these four games... and all of them were
tied or we were behind late, in every one of them. To make those kind of plays
down the stretch, we made a couple great defensive plays when they were going
to the basket, a couple deflections, a couple blocks. Mooky got a couple just
huge rebounds down there.  
But it was a great, great tournament. I'm really glad for Gerry. He started
his career a little bit, probably a little bit too good, and where are you
going to go after that? But he's come back and had four great years for us.
He's got unbelievable heart; he really does.  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Terrence Roberts and Demetris Nichols. Questions,
please.  
Q. You talked yesterday about how the line between winning, one shot, once
you do win, does it become contagious?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, we had a lot of confidence. But we've had confidence.
We've been good in close games, we just didn't have enough close games
(smiling). We got beat too bad. I think we're 12-3 now or something in close
games. We couldn't get in close games.  
But, yeah, I think you get some. But these guys have a lot of confidence and
they step up and make plays.  
Q. You sure you don't want to reconsider him being "overrated"?   
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I think we answered -- well, it never really was something
that was seriously considered by anybody other than somebody that knows zero.
The only reason I reacted to it is I don't like people talking about my
people, and I really don't like somebody in my hometown talking about people.
Somebody in New York wants to talk about him, you know, I guess I can't
control that too much, you know. If I didn't speak to somebody in New York,
they'd probably think that was good. If I threaten not to talk to you anymore,
that would be a good thing, wouldn't it (smiling)?  
But, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's over.  
Q. Terrence, talk about the energy of you guys after three unbelievably
tough games. You came out with a lot of energy to start the game.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Terrence had a lot of energy because he didn't really
expend too much last night (laughter).  
Q. Especially on defense early.  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: Definitely. I think what Coach said had a lot to do with it.
I didn't do much last night so I thought I had a lot to prove tonight. I had
to do a really good job for my team to win this game. I just went out there
and gave it my all. I just tried to keep my guys energetic. When they took a
lead late in the game, I just tried to keep them energetic and keep them going
and let them know the game was far from over.  
Q. What did you need to do that you hadn't been doing coming in here?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: We got everybody involved, that's all. Gerry has played
pretty well all year. In spite of the rumors that he hasn't, he's been pretty
good. He made shots here, but he didn't, you know, have 28-, 29-point games
here. I thought he passed better, he penetrated better.  
But the big difference were, you know, were Terrence and Mooky inside. And
then when D steps up like he did tonight, we really become a dangerous team.
He struggled a little bit in some of our games, but when he steps up like
tonight, he was a force in the game tonight, especially early, to get us
established. And when he steps up like that, and our big guys contribute,
that's why we can do what we did here.  
And I think actually coming out of this tournament this year we're better than
we were coming out last year. We relied on Hakim and Gerry a little bit too
much last year. I really felt that. We could never quite -- it was working,
you know. This year, what we were doing wasn't working this year. Now I think
we're playing actually much better - even though we won last year - we're
playing much better now.  
What does that mean about the next game? Nothing. This means something.  
Q. The conference was deep coming into this tournament. What do you think
the tournament says about the conference? What's your feeling on how many bids
you will have?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, the eighth seed got to the finals last year and got
to the finals of the regionals last year, West Virginia. Ninth seed won it
this year. You know, Notre Dame and Louisville are really good basketball
teams. Rutgers finished.  
I mean, we said the league turned out -- we thought it would be good, I think
it even turned out better because we had the top teams and we had, I think as
of today, Pitt was probably 10 in the RPI. I know Connecticut and Villanova
are 2, 3. Georgetown and Marquette and us, you know, Top 20 now probably.  
I mean, but the bottom teams are good. I mean, South Florida gave six or seven
or eight teams very difficult games. They beat Georgetown. Georgetown comes in
here and could have been in the finals very easily.  
Q. Coach, you've had a lot of great moments here and a lot of great teams.
Where does this rank?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: This is the best, by far. By far, this is the best
(applause).  
THE MODERATOR: Please hold your applause. This is the media room.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: That's why I can curse in here, because it's supposed to be
a press room. There's supposed to be adults here.  
Q. Right after Pittsburgh took that lead just for a second, Gerry comes back
and nails his three. Can you tell me, how significant a three is that? How big
a shot was that? What did it do?  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: I mean, really wasn't a surprise. He's been doing it all
week long. We didn't expect him not to do it. I mean, we were very confident.
All we had to do was play defense. If we played defense, got key stops and
rebounds, even if they did take the lead late in the game, we'd still be able
to pull away from it.  
Q. What did it do for you guys?  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: Gave us an emotional lift. Some guys were down. They were
hitting tough shots, getting a lot of calls and stuff like that. For him to
hit that shot in the situation we were in was key for us.  
Q. This year the guys cut down the nets.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: They do what they want to do after the game. If they want
to cut down the nets, that's good. They earned it. They deserved it.  
Q. Gerry, these last four days, the way you started them, the way you
finished them, does it quite feel the way you expected it to feel?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Does what feel?  
Q. The feeling you have right now, the crowd just yelling your name right at
the end of the game, all the adulation, everything surrounding the victory?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: We always have great support in the city. It's great for us to
play here, come down here because of the support we have. All week long
they've been great to me, great to the team. I think they did help us this
week. You know, I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but it
certainly does help. It doesn't hurt.  
So, you know, for us to come down here in the situation we were in and to win
it is pretty impressive.  
Q. I know you probably have been asked this a million times, Gerry, how
motivated were you here? Can you reflect at all on what you accomplished over
these four days? Did you want to prove something to people?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, we won it, so I guess I was pretty motivated. I think we
all were. You know, you can't really say enough about my teammates and Coach
and all the coaching staff really throughout the year. This is the toughest
year I've played, and for these guys to battle and to come down here and fight
and to do this is, like Coach said, it's one of the greatest.  
We won this last year, but it was a different story. We had a great regular
season. We came down here with a team that was polished, a team that was
experienced, and this year we're new. We're new to each other, and we couldn't
get it going for a while. We come down here and just get it going. When
Terrence and Mooky play big for us inside, and Demetris is hitting shots,
we're pretty tough to beat. That was the case down here. They played great,
and the rest is history.  
Q. If you could speak about just anything more personally for you. I mean,
you are the leader of this team. To be able to help what wasn't a polished
team win a title. Coach said it was the best tournament ever. Does it feel
more special to you?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Absolutely. I'm the lone senior. Obviously, this week was
emotional for me because of the press and what happened. For us to come down
here and do this is a great thing. We were on the outside looking in coming
down here, and now there's a lot of teams looking at us.  
So we're happy with what we accomplished. You know, we're moving on and we're
proud of that.  
Q. Coach, you mentioned last night, obviously without Gerry's shot against
Cincinnati on Thursday, this wasn't possible. (Inaudible) Can you talk about
all the shots he made throughout the tournament.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: First of all, the first one, we wouldn't have been playing.
Then the next one, we wouldn't have been playing anymore. The play on the fast
break, the shot before that, last night's game, and then this shot. So, you
know, pick your -- some guys win one game once in a while, in a year or two. I
don't think anybody's ever won four games in a row by making "the" play of the
game. That's pretty special.  
And the biggest thing is Gerry had a lot of help here, and that's what I'm
happiest about when it comes for next week, which is what everybody knows, is
what people remember. There's only one thing people remember about last year
with our team, and if I hear Tom Brennan mention it one more freakin' time -
is that a curse word? No? That's okay.  
Every time I turn on the television, they're talking about upsets. I love
Tommy, he's a great guy. Whoever's with him says, "You know all about upsets."
That was like four times today. Let's get over it. I'm going to pay him not to
work so...  
This could be at least two, three, four more years this is gonna, you know...  
He should send me like a check, shouldn't he, or something (laughter)?  
Q. Gerry, two-part question for you. You walked towards the Syracuse bench.
You were walking towards where we sit. Tell me what was going through your
mind. Was it exhaustion? What was going through your head?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: At the end, you mean?  
Q. Yes.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, I kind of stay away from the pile. I'm not the biggest
guy, so half the time I'm getting run over. I kind of go to the side a little
bit and a couple guys will come over. But that's the way I like it. I was on a
big pile one time and I got kicked in the face. That was after we won the
championship, so...  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: That was worth it, though.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Yeah, I didn't mind it.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: We'll get in a pile one more time.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: If we won the National Championship, I'd lie on the ground and
the whole team could kick me in the face (laughter).  
Q. What was said was said earlier in the week. You heard the way Jim
reacted. Were you surprised by how strongly he reacted? You heard what he
said, the way he said it. Did you say, "Whoa"?   
GERRY MCNAMARA: I was more proud than surprised. It's a great thing when your
coach goes to bat for you and protects one of his guys. I took that as a
compliment. I'm proud to say that, I'm proud to say I have a coach that will
go to bat for his kids. That's what it's all about. We have to protect each
other. When you play on a team, you're family. You have to back each other up
and stay on each other's side. If you don't do that, you're not going to
accomplish much. I was just proud to say he did that for me.  
Q. When that kind of press comes around, does it stay with you or do you
dismiss it, Gerry?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, yeah, I mean, it's tough when people call you
"overrated." I mean, there's no question about that.  
But, you know, you can't go too far into it. You know, half the people that
said that never picked up a basketball in their life, you know. The Daily
Orange at our school, those guys, you know what I mean?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: They must be here, aren't you guys? Huh?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Yeah, they're probably here.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Is he still "overrated"?  
Q. I didn't call him "overrated."   
GERRY MCNAMARA: It was Ethan Ramsay (phonetic spelling). I know who he is
(laughter). He's not here, is he?  
Q. Not tonight.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: He was probably at all the losses we had.  
Q. How does it feel, Coach? Obviously it was different this year having to
go through the four games. But still two BIG EAST Championships in a row.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: This is still a great feeling. This is still a great
league. To win it is a great feeling. The unfortunate thing is that in college
basketball, for a program like ours, the only thing that matters is what
starts next week. Shouldn't be that way, but that's life. That's the way it
is. You have to accept it. I accepted it a long time ago. We just got to get
ready for next week. This will help us. This is a good experience for our
guys.  
Q. Coach, saw John Wallace out there. How much does this team kind of remind
you of that team ten years ago that didn't have the highest expectations and
went all the way to the NCAA final?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: That's a fair question. That team got together near the end
really, and we had a great senior point guard - of course, John. Things came
together for that team. It can happen. College basketball, anything can
happen. We all know that it's more open now than it's ever been. The
tournament's more open now than it's ever been. You can see that by watching
these tournaments unfold today and what's happening. There's some great teams
out there. I mean, I've seen a couple teams in the last couple days that
really impress me with how they played. It's just going to be a great
tournament. It will be a great tournament to watch. It's always been good, but
it's never been this good. It's never been this good, this much balance. There
will be some unbelievable games in the next few weeks.  
Q. Demetris, everybody else seems to be talking, you're quiet but having a
good time up there. What are your thoughts on this week?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: It's been a great four days, you know. We came in here
confident. A lot of people really didn't have faith in us. We had to kind of
like -- we had a chip on our shoulder, you know. We felt like we had a lot to
prove to ourselves and to you guys.  
It's a great feeling. It's a great feeling.  
Q. Jim, you've had quite a few guys that have played well. Can you compare
their play with the tournament Gerry has had.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, he's had an unbelievable tournament. Sherman had a
couple down here, too, and Pearl had the best game I've ever seen played by a
player against the best defense that I've ever seen.  
But this performance was four days in a row. I haven't seen anyone - anyone on
any team. I'm sure I haven't seen every game -- well, I have seen every game,
I haven't seen them all in person, but I have seen them played. I haven't seen
any one guy do what Gerry did here this week. Not even close.  
Q. Terrence, after last night, can you talk about the first five minutes of
today's game and the two dunks early.  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: I had a lot of guys on my side and backing me and just
letting me know that last night was over. I mean, yeah, I played hard
yesterday but, you know what, Matt Gorman stepped in, made big plays for us.
That's all that really matters. All my coaches had faith and said I'm due for
a good game today. I just wanted to come out and give my all. That's what I
did.  
Q. Demetris, had a lot of stops last three minutes of the game. You hit a
three from the corner. How big was that?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Big. Big. That was big. I can answer that. I'll answer that
one.  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: Okay, go ahead, Coach.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: It was big.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: ... It looked a lot worse than it was. Al is going to be
released. He has vision and it's going to be day-to-day prognosis now. But
it's much, much better than we initially anticipated.  
Q. He's going to be released tonight?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: He's going to be released tonight. He'll go home with us.
He'll have some medication. They said we'll check him in the next couple days
and see how he is. See if he can play.  
Q. From what you saw, did you fear it was worse?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I haven't seen it yet. I heard. I just heard. That's why I
say it "looked" a lot worse than it was. I don't want to go into detail
because I didn't see it. I know what everyone said they saw. The good thing is
the last time I talked to you, they said he was starting to get his vision
back. Now he's got his vision back to the point where they feel confident to
release him. He's going to be fine?  
Q. Will he go home with you tonight?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, he's going to go home with us tomorrow.  
Q. Will you take a guess as to whether or not he can play in the next
game?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I don't know. They said day-to-day. I got to feel very good?  
Q. Say anything about the cornea?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, no. They said they're going to release him. No scratched
cornea.  
Q. What's the official injury? What are they calling it?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Soft tissue injury of the right eye.  
Q. Stitches or anything?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, no.  
Q. Basically he got poked in the eye?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yes, yes.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I feel great for him right now. When I came to see you guys,
they said this is very serious. They said they'll keep checking. When I got
back, they said, "Hey, great news. He's got his vision." Everybody knows what
everybody saw. They just said it just looked a lot worse than it was.  
I sent my assistant to tell him (inaudible). I'll be with us tonight. It's
good. We have to go day by day to see how he is, but this is the best possible
-- there were a lot of scenarios. I guess they had to be cautious first,
that's what they hit me with. This is the best possible scenario. So it's
great news.  
Q. Medications are to help the swelling or prevent infection?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: That, I don't know. Just drops. Just drops.  
Q. Is it hard for you the second half, is that in the back of your mind the
whole time?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know what, honestly, I didn't know how serious it was.
You know, I tried to move the guys away from him, they didn't bother the
doctors. I just concentrated on the team. Kept asking where he was. Finally,
someone said they took him to the hospital.  
I still just, for some reason, assumed he was going to okay. They were being
cautious. I didn't know until after we met with the team.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I feel great right now, exactly. Exactly right. I feel
great. I mean, as you all know, you think about this season, you're thinking
about -- I didn't ask if he could play. I was more worried about his future.
They said he's fine (inaudible).  
They said day by day now.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I don't know. I don't know. You know what, right now, like
they said someone else had a scratched cornea. That would have been more
serious than what he is right now. They just said it's the best possible case.  
Q. Doctors on site thought it was serious and took him to the hospital.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Well, over time, his sight, he couldn't see when he was
here. Then being there, they did a great job there. Everybody did a great job.
Our trainer got right to him. They explained to me there was pressure on it
right away. Got him down to Saint Vincent's immediately, got an
ophthalmologist rushed in there, took care of him right away. Then they just
had to wait to see.  
When I first saw them, they said his vision was starting to come back. Now
they said his vision's good and they're going to release him.  
Q. Did you talk to him?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, I haven't talked to him yet.  
Thanks, guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Randy Foye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13767)

### [Kyle Lowry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13766)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We really haven't had a game like that this year where we
just felt like we couldn't get things going offensively. Then I thought that
Pittsburgh, once they got a hold of the game, did a great job of just
controlling the tempo and hitting big shots, making free throws. We've usually
been able to, when we weren't scoring, take people out of what they do
offensively with our defense and create some shots. I just think Pittsburgh's
guards did a great job of controlling the game and taking care of the ball.
They just did a great job against us.  
Q. Can you talk about Allan.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Allan has a serious injury, but he's doing okay. He's being
evaluated right now. That's really all we can say at this point.  
Q. How much did his lack of presence on the floor hurt you guys?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: He's one of our top players, that obviously makes a
difference. But we have won games - and I think that's what's made us a good
team all year - we've had games without Mike, we've had games without Allan,
without Kyle, and we've found a way to win. We couldn't do that tonight.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players._  
Q. Was it hard for you guys, just having your minds on Allan?  
RANDY FOYE: When Allan got hurt, Coach just brought us in a huddle. He said,
"Don't worry about that right now. We'll worry about it after the game. Just
keep our heads into the game, just keep playing hard."  
Q. Does it change the way you look at the rest of the season?  
RANDY FOYE: Allan, he's a big part of what we do. But if he is, like, out for
the season or whatever - which I doubt - but if he is, then we just have to
come together like we did before. Like Coach said before, Allan has been out,
Mike has been out, and the team just came together. We came together and got
even closer and just tried to go out there and just play as hard as we can.  
Q. You guys, did Antonio Graves surprise you with what he was able to do
today? Did you see that on the scouting report, he could hurt you that way?  
KYLE LOWRY: It was on the scouting report. He just got it going. He was
getting good looks. Every good look he got, he hit it, knocked the shot down.
It wasn't surprising. He just got it going. Couldn't do anything about it.  
Q. Along those same lines, Pitt has a lot of new players, Levance Fields,
Sam Young. Talk about not seeing them before and their contribution.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I mean, we got to see them a little bit on TV. I'm very
impressed. If you played in that game against them, you have to be impressed.
They had all the answers. When we double-teamed them, they made the extra
pass, they hit the three. When we pressured their guards, took their guards,
they went inside, and Gray made big plays. They defended very well. Really got
to give them credit.  
I think they get great leadership from Krauser. I think their young guys are
really good. I was very impressed.  
Q. Considering that you guys start with four guards, is Pitt the type of
team you fear going in? Can that team cause more problems than most because of
the matchup?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, that team can give us trouble. As I said, we have
found ways in the past to eliminate that or make up for that, and I just give
them a lot of credit. I thought they did a good job on the glass - obviously.
I mean, they killed us on the glass. But we've usually been able to be tough
enough to outrebound people or spread the floor out a little bit so they
weren't able to be around the basket. I just thought they just did a good job
of keeping their big guys around the basket and letting their guards control
the ball.  
Q. As much as I'm sure you're disappointed right now, losing the game and
not winning the tournament, is that affected by your concern for Allan? Are
you in a strange place right now with how you're feeling?  
RANDY FOYE: Yes, we're concerned about Allan right now because he's one of the
leaders on our team and he's a big part of what we do. But we know if Allan
can't play, we still have to come together as a team and we still have a job
to do.  
Q. Curtis getting injured, Jason is injured, Mike. How are you coming back
from that?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Hey, we won a BIG EAST Championship and made it to the
semifinals and we got good kids, good students, good families. There's worse
things in the world. They understand. They'll come back from this. They'll
come back.  
Q. What do you say to the team to keep them going? They're having a tough
night, what do you say to the guys on the floor to keep it going?  
RANDY FOYE: Just tell them keep playing defense, just stay focused on the
floor, don't worry about anything on the outside. Just stay focused, keep
playing hard, keep fighting.  
Q. Jay, you came close before. Given the depth of the conference now, did
you think it was inevitable that some team was going to win four games in four
days? Someone is going to do it this year, obviously.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know, I didn't. I didn't think someone would do it this
year because of the depth of the conference, because of how much every game is
going to take out of you.  
This is real impressive, both teams, Pitt and Syracuse. It doesn't surprise
me, any of the upsets, because, you know, we knew we could get beat any night.
But it surprised me that somebody is going to do this, and it's probably the
only way you could do it, if two teams played four nights and then play each
other.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Levance Fields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13769)

### [Antonio Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13770)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Levance Fields and Antonio Graves will be the players for
Pittsburgh._  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: First thing is I don't know really what happened. Our team
is very concerned about Allan and how he's doing, and our thoughts are with
Allan and what happened. I didn't see the play, but I hope he's okay. That's
our first concern, and we've talked about it after the game. He's a great kid,
a great player. We've known him, St. Raymond's guy, we've known him for a long
time.  
We played very well. We rebounded and we beat a very good team - a great team.
I'm proud of how our guys played. I'm proud of Levon Kendall, how he responded
and came back for us and how these two guys played and made plays all night
long.  
I thought our guys, it was a whole team effort. Just our defense, our
rebounding and our decision-making was solid all the way through. We were
fortunate to beat a very good team, and we've got to get ready for Syracuse
now, get our rest tonight.  
Again, I'm very proud of these guys.  
Q. You've been talking about your depth all year. Can you talk about your
bench tonight.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, I guess the numbers say it right there. I
mean, these two guys here made shots all night. Made -- rebounded well, played
well last night as well.  
Bringing Levon off now, I guess you get some points there, too. It's a
strength of ours. We use it. We expect it. So it's not unexpected for us. We
have good players and we have a lot of good players. That's a good thing to
have.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the work off the offense.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, last two games we've talked
about it. I mean, going into this game, when you're talking about a West
Virginia team and a Villanova team that are very good at a lot of things,
rebounding is not their strongest suit. They are great passers, great
shooters, great defenders, a great defensive team, Villanova, but we really
felt we had to beat them on the boards in a big way. We did that last night
and we did it tonight as well.  
It's something, you know, certain teams focus on certain things. Ours is
rebounding. We have to win the battle on the boards. We practice it every day.
Our drills are based around rebounding, blockouts, getting the rebounds. You
don't finish a drill unless you block out. You don't get the point unless you
block out. I think that carries over and puts us where we're at rebounding-
wise.  
Q. Either of you see what happened to Allan in the scuffle?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: No, no, we were on the bench at the time.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: No.  
Q. Levance, did you like the idea of the matchup, getting a chance to go
against them?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Most definitely. We feel we have a good group of guards also.
We come in, me and Tone will come in for Carl and Ronald, they start off, do a
good job. Keith is in there, he does a great job.  
We heard a lot about them all year. We were looking forward to it. We didn't
get to play them in the regular season. I think we held our own tonight.  
Q. You've talked all year about not being on team's radars. Still okay with
that?  
ANTONIO GRAVES: Yes, yes, yes. But, I mean, we all -- like Levance said, we're
a deep team. I think, you know, us not being -- our players on the bench not
being on the scouting report, you know, that's little because you have to
watch out for us now. Everybody should know now that you have to watch out for
us. We're a deep team, we play well together, and we share the ball, so that's
all that counts.  
Q. For the players, Carl Krauser played 20 minutes tonight. He's been the
team leader for several years now. What was it like with him on the bench?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: I think we all did, you know, it wasn't one person. It was a
team effort, like Coach Dixon said. Carl was in foul trouble. Early in the
season we had to get over that against Notre Dame with him fouling out. Things
just carry over. Today, me, Tone, everybody on the team stepped up in his
place, and we got the job done.  
Q. The way you finished the regular season, did you come in here with a
little bit of a chip on your shoulder this tournament?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Most definitely. We definitely had a chip on our shoulder.
Definitely because we lost our last game at home. Being undefeated at home,
losing to Seton Hall really hurt us, and West Virginia on the road. Games we
both felt we could have won. We wanted to come in and prove something, but at
the same time, we're taking it a game at a time. Now we're going to get ready
for Syracuse.  
Q. Can you talk about Syracuse. You're playing your fourth straight game,
both teams. That's even. Can you talk about playing them and the challenges
they pose.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: First off, I'll say that I know they said no team won four
games in a row, so that's gonna be broken tomorrow.  
But Syracuse, you know, they got Gerry who is playing excellent right now.
They're big down low. We have to attack the zone. We'll have to be aggressive.
We'll have to run some of our plays and try to get a couple of baskets in
transition. We'll definitely have to attack the zone and play good defense.  
Q. You talked about your rebounding, Jamie. What did you guys do, do you
think, to force them into bad shots initially?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I thought Coach Sandle did a good job on the scouting
report, preparing in a short period of time. Not often do you play a team in a
tournament where you haven't played them before during the season. So not a
lot of time for preparation.  
I thought we had -- coverage is what we wanted to do. We had a good game plan
going in, and the guys executed it throughout.  
We knew what they wanted to do. We knew how good they are off the dribble and
scoring, taking guys. But our guys just continued and battled. We understood
that they're going to make shots. They make tough shots. They're that good.
You have to continue to play defense, stick to your principals, stick to our
rules defensively even after they make a difficult shot and do it again.
That's something that we really stress.  
Q. Do you feel you might be one of the teams in the country that might match
their guards?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I know how great they are. They're all guys we've
recruited. We've known these guys for ever and are aware of how good they are.
It's not a surprise that they've become as good a players as they are. I do
have a lot of confidence in our players, I really do. Sometimes our numbers
may not be as dramatic as others because we play four or five, we play five of
them really and sometimes six. We understand that, our guys understand that.
They understand the sacrifices that come with that. It's a big part of our
team.  
But they know that each time - and we know it's not a surprise that these two
guys are up here tonight. They've done it before.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Brandon Bowman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13732)

### [Roy Hibbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13731)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Georgetown is here. It's going to be Roy Hilbert, Brandon
Bowman and Coach John Thompson III._  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Questions?  
Q. Can you talk about how tentative you guys got in the second half. It
looked like everything you did in the first half, it just looked more
tentative.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Yeah, you know, maybe we did. I'm not sure. They took
away the middle a little bit. We got it in there. At the end, you know, we
probably were a little stagnant.  
Q. Free throws, one guy starts doing it, the next guy gets up there
(inaudible).  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't know. We haven't had that happen too much. We
were, what, 8 for 17. You make your foul shots, it's a different game.  
Q. There was a time-out you called right after a made basket. Can you tell
us, was that to deal with defensive assignments with McNamara?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: He's a great player and he showed that tonight. I
mean, he willed them to win. He put them on his back and he willed them to
win.  
But that is correct, we called that time-out because we wanted to just make
sure we were focusing on him. Make sure everyone's energy was on him. And it
did not matter. It did not matter. He's a terrific player who's a senior who
decided he doesn't want to lose. That's the long and short of it.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We worked on that and I thought that you call a time-
out, it gives them an opportunity to get their defense set up. Over the past
couple years we've been in that situation and we've scored. I thought we'd get
it out, get it in right away and maybe have outnumbering situations, maybe
have mismatches. Yeah, you can call a time-out, you can go back and forth on
that. But we haven't done that. We've worked on it. Guys know to get it out,
feel the lanes. We may get an advantage doing that as opposed to calling a
time-out and letting them set up their defense. That's something that's by
design.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players._  
Q. Brandon, with their defense, in terms of creating all the turnovers
tonight, would you say you guys contributed to that?  
BRANDON BOWMAN: I would say a little bit of both. It seems like in the second
half their zone was a little bit more tight than it was in the first half. We
didn't get the ball to the high post enough as we should. That was due to
their defense. They were tight. They were getting out, closing on the three-
point line. Then you have us, you know, missing a few layups here and there,
making a couple turnovers. They countered on it every time. Every mistake we
ever made in the second half, it seems like they scored on.  
I mean, when things like that happen, it's anybody's game.  
_THE MODERATOR: Georgetown, thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Darryl Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13764)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Darryl Watkins, Demetris Nichols and Gerry McNamara with Coach
Jim Boeheim._  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: The difference in the second half is our defense. We just
got to their shooters better. When they got it inside, Mooky just did a great
job of being a presence and making them miss some shots.  
I would think we'd be tired, but, you know, they helped us. I don't know
whether they were tired missing those free throws or what, but our guys never
give up. They never give up. Even this year when we were down early, we were
down 20, 30 against Connecticut and 20 at Villanova, we never had given up. We
end up losing those games, but we kept coming back and trying to come back.
This game was -- we were in bad position at half time, probably as bad as you
can be against a team that controls the tempo like Georgetown does. You're not
going to get back in it quick.  
We said, "Let's cut it to ten in the first six minutes," and we got it to nine
in five minutes. We wanted to cut it again by the 10-minute mark. We did a
little better than we thought. Then when we got it down close, we made a
couple mistakes, freshmen mistakes. He's not here (laughter).  
But, you know, Matty came in, gave us a huge lift. He got Gerry open a couple
times. If Gerry gets a look, you know, he's gonna make it. We put him off the
ball in the second half. He got some looks. It's harder for him to take the
ball right now, but coming off the screen it's a little easier for him. When
he gets those looks, he makes them. He's a big-game player, he's a big shot-
maker. I knew when we made the three, we were gonna press, it was two. But, I
just felt they had been very, you know, tentative on offense. I thought if we
made a good defensive stand that we could get a transition basket, and just
sometimes things - once in a great while things work out the way you'd like
them to.  
Then we got back and played good defense. Mooky made a good play. This was a
heck of a comeback from that kind of a deficit against a controlled team.
Georgetown's coming in here, I thought they played great in both their games.
You just can't give anybody that kind of lead, I don't think, and expect to
come back. But these guys don't -- they just keep plugging away. As long as we
get Gerry some looks, he's gonna make his share, I think.  
We keep playing all these teams, we're going to find that assistant coach that
said he was "overrated" pretty soon.  
Q. Build a monument?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: We're either gonna find the assistant coach, or that guy's
already home. One or the other (smiling).  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, Derek (ph) gave everybody a pep talk at half time. I
should have let him come in the locker room, I could have saved some of the
stuff I had coming in. He's a lot tougher than I am, he threatens them
physically. I've never done that.  
It was great seeing him and Pearl (ph) there and Lawrence (ph). That was
great. Derek has been as good a supporter as anybody. I've always said he's
the most misunderstood guy in athletics. He's got a big heart and he really,
you know -- if he's on your side, you'll never have to worry about having a
friend, a guy that you can count on.  
Nobody that ever played with him or even played against him ever didn't like
him. Just a few of you guys don't like him - maybe for good reason, too.  
Q. Can you talk about Gerry's minutes?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Trainer said he was at 50% and I looked at him and said,
"Yeah, but he'll be there." He's gonna be there. He got tired quick early,
then he got going. You know, he's a gamer. He's going to play. That's all.
He's going to play. I don't worry about him.  
Q. Coach, have you ever had a kid have three straight games like this for
you in all your years of coaching? Can you speak about the contribution of
Gorman.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Gorman, Matt was tremendous. I should have brought him in
here, too. He's tremendous. He's been trying that three all year. I told him,
I said, "Some day you're gonna make one of those things." Just came up at the
right time. But he is a good shooter. He was good. He did some really good
things on offense and some really good things on defense. Mooky was tremendous
on defense, really did just a great job for us.  
Q. Last year you were talking about how you played here (inaudible)?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I hate to be right like that, Pete (smiling).  
Q. Does it feel better this year?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, you know, I mean, I just don't think there's any
relationship to what you necessarily do here and, you know, what you do --
these tournaments are so underdog oriented now anyway. You see games, these
teams that have to win, they're playing their hearts out. I mean, Wake Forest
is just killing people down there. And South Carolina beat Tennessee, they
probably didn't, you know -- I mean, you know, when you're fighting for your
life, you're going to beat teams that maybe are better. The real truth of the
matter is the teams that are better aren't that much better; they really
aren't. I mean, it's what's scary in college basketball. If we would have come
here and had -- and this is the truth - - if Gerry doesn't make the hardest
shot he had to make here, we're home and we're not going anywhere. The scary
thing is we could win two, three, four games, five, six, who knows, in the
NCAA tournament. We're good enough. But if he doesn't make that shot, we're
not in the tournament - and rightfully so.  
But that's college basketball. It's really, it's crazy. It's a crazy game.  
Q. Gerry, can you talk about the first half versus the second. First half,
you were kind of quiet. How were you feeling? Second half, it was different.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, the first half, like Coach said, we were just trying to
monitor my minutes and, you know, take it minute by minute and see how I felt.
Second half, there was really no question what was going to happen because I
saw the scoreboard at half time. We went down 15 at the buzzer. So whether how
I was feeling or not, it didn't matter, it was time to play. You know, it was
our time. We didn't want to come down here just to win two games and go home.
We wanted to come down here and try to win it, you know. That's why you come
here. That's the purpose of coming here. We didn't want to just say, "Oh, we
beat UCONN, hopefully we're in the tournament, let's go home." We didn't want
it to be like that. That's not how this team is. I'm just proud. I'm proud of
these guys for the way they're fighting. It could have been easy for us to
quit tonight, especially late in the game, especially at halftime, too. We
played two tough games, and it's easy to lay over on this third one. But I'm
proud that we battled back. First two games we blew a lead. This time we had
to come back from a lead, and that's pretty impressive.  
Q. Gerry, can you tell us how you're feeling now. Is there anything you have
to do to get ready for tomorrow?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: I feel great right now.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Tomorrow morning!  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Yeah, tomorrow morning is the tough thing. Our trainer did a
great job with me. If it weren't for him, you know, I probably wouldn't have
played.  
Actually, I probably would have played, but he got me ready to play. A lot of
ice bath, a lot of treatment. You know, I'm sure there's a lot of other people
that have to do this. This is a long season. Back-to-back games, it's tough.  
I'm just trying to take care of my body and just stay healthy. We still have
another game.  
Q. Darryl, can you talk about the difference in the first half and second
half.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Lean close. Close. Close. He's rookie at this stuff.  
DARRYL WATKINS: First half, I didn't really know, like, what they were gonna
do. By the second half we started like learning from the first half like what
they were more going to, like, try to break down our two-three zone or one-on-
one. So that's it.  
Q. For the players, have either one of you played with a guy who's as well-
liked as Gerry? You see the end of games, he could win for Mayor of New
York.  
DARRYL WATKINS: No, this is my first experience (smiling).  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: It's my first experience, too. Gerry has been great the
whole year. I think this is the way to go out, you know. He started off, you
know, good and he's going out with a bang. That's the way to go out. I'm proud
of him (smiling).  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I think one thing, too, to mention, this is still Syracuse-
Georgetown, this is still a big game, it always has been, always will be. John
has done a tremendous job in a very short period of time to get them back
where they are. We were just fortunate we made a couple plays at the end today
and that was, you know -- that's what happens in these games.  
Q. You guys were physically and emotionally exhausted going into half time
down 15. What did you say to get ready for the second half?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I don't think we can go into everything that was said in
the locker room. We just wanted to come back and be a little more physical on
defense and get to their shooters a little bit better.  
Offensively, we just put Gerry off the ball a little bit and let Eric bring it
up. We got a couple good, quick baskets, and that kind of got us going, you
know. We kind of got back in it quick. When you're 15 down and you can get a
couple quick baskets, it's a 10-point game and you still have 16 minutes to
go. It's not so much to overcome really.  
When we got it back, the fouls were four to two, we had six straight fouls
called against us. As it turned out, they started missing so I guess it was
good strategy, that foul and stuff.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: This is the best ever, by far. Even after yesterday. When
you come to New York, unfortunately, we're not in that position a lot. But
when you have to come to New York, not many teams come here and do it, you
know, over the years, when you look back. Usually the favorites win here. I
remember 'cause I was once in that position (smiling)... for a few years.  
But we had to come to New York and there's no doubt in my mind we needed to
win both games. I think we would have deserved to be in after one, but I think
we had to win two. That's a lot of pressure when you're playing the best team
in the country. The Connecticut game, even though we got ahead, they were
tied, you know. They were ahead late. So it wasn't like we got -- they gave us
the game early and they could never come back. They had the lead and they were
playing then. So maybe they didn't play early, but whether that's true or not,
I'm not going to even debate that.  
But they had the lead, and they were playing. We had their attention, I think,
at that time. It wasn't like we got up 20 and they never got the attention
'til it was too late, like last year. So we still had to win that game. That
would have made this tournament the best I've ever been involved in. Tonight
is just another, you know, step.  
Again, we come here to win. We don't come down here to win a game or two; we
come down here to win. It's a great tournament. If you need to win, it's nice
to do it. But it's still a great -- I think it's still great preparation. Even
the years that we've lost here, I think it's good preparation for us. We've
learned some things about our team this week. On offense, we've picked up a
couple things. Some guys showed some things they can do. That's really going
to help us in the tournament, it's going to help us next year. The way Mooky
and Demetris have stepped up, the way Matt did and Terrence until tonight has
got us here, he had two huge games. Eric, this has been a great experience for
him. This tournament is tremendous. We've been to the finals a lot and we want
to get there and we want to play well tomorrow night. It will be a tough game.
Whoever wins, these two teams are great teams, I think. Villanova is the No. 1
team in the country now. I think Pittsburgh is a top 10 team, I always have,
all year.  
That's a great challenge for us tomorrow night.  
Q. Gerry, you've known Matt for a long time. He hasn't had moments like this
much. Can you talk about the game he had tonight.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, Matty is such a great player, but, you know, for a few
years it's tough when you play behind guys like Carmelo Anthony and Hakim
Warrick, Terrence and Mook.  
We've had some great forwards over the years, but Matt is probably one of the
top scoring forwards we've had. He might be a better scorer than Hakim was,
especially on the perimeter. It's tough for him to... well...  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He is Gerry's roommate.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Yeah (smiling).  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: That sometimes clouds judgment.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: I think what makes Matt really successful is he doesn't rely
on athleticism. He relies on being intelligent and knowing where to be on the
floor, how to get me shots, how to get himself a shot. I got him an open shot
because he rolled off a screen that he set. When you're intelligent and you
know what you're doing out there, it makes you that much more effective. I
think Matty is as intelligent as it gets at knowing who needs the ball at
certain times. He knows when he comes in he has to set screens for me. I know
if he's on the three-point line, if he's open, I'm giving it to him because he
can make it.  
What he did, he hasn't played a ton. When he's played, he's produced. I'm
proud, not just as a teammate, but as a friend, I'm proud that he's gotten his
opportunity and when he's gotten in there, he's produced. That's the most
important thing.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Allan Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13760)

### [Will Sheridan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13761)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We played against the leading scorer in the BIG EAST in the
first half and we played them like we didn't know he was the leading scorer in
the BIG EAST. He hit some deep, deep shots and some tough shots. I think we
were ready to play and I think he was just incredible in the first half. I
think Allen, Randy, in the second half, we just kept fresh bodies on. They did
a great job. We played team defense. That was the difference. Just finally
getting Douby under control. He got 31, I'm saying we got him under control.
He was incredible in the first half.  
_THE MODERATOR: We have Allan Ray and Will Sheridan here._  
Q. Are you starting to feel better about him scoring when he gets an
opportunity to score?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, I'm always fine with him scoring. Just that we have so
much options. He's always the one that no one talks about. You know, everyone
talks about the four guards. Well, if there's four guards, there's one other
guy but we never talk about him. He does all the dirty work and he keeps a
great attitude. When the ball gets to him, he makes plays. Last year in the
NCAA tournament he did it, we know he can do it. Just depends on how people
play him.  
Q. Did the UCONN loss come up at all, in terms of keeping everybody
focused?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, I mean, our guys are playing well and they're
confident. I want them to be that way. But I felt this afternoon was a good
dose of reality. Without it happening, it still happened on the court. You
hope you don't have to go through it in the first half, but we did anyway.  
But we talked about the fact that I thought UCONN came ready to play, too, but
in tournament time it only takes one game, one guy getting it going, and we
definitely used that as something to learn from.  
Q. Did you do anything differently in the second half defensively, or was it
a matter of Allen and Randy playing more in space?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We didn't do anything different except for the fact that, it
just seemed in the first half, there was loose balls where he got the ball and
then there was sometimes when we got switched on to him and he just backed up
a little bit. He hit two threes, that we had, one Will and one Dante
Cunningham were on him, it must have been 32 feet. They're just not used to
guarding someone like that that far from the basket. He drilled them.  
So we were doing a good job for a while in the first half, and then he just
broke loose 'cause a lot of them were in transition also.  
Q. Is this as balanced as you've seen the team?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, we did, offensively, in the first half I thought we
played all right offensively. Also, we just couldn't control Quincy. Second
half, I thought we spread the ball out pretty well. That was good for us.  
Q. Is that a key to winning here, to be balanced? Obviously, you have one
player who scores 31 points.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, any time we can spread it out like that, I love it.  
Q. Will, you had a big first half. Allen, obviously a big finish down the
stretch. Can you guys talk about the flow and how you got into it, you, early
on, Will, then later on Allen.  
WILL SHERIDAN: I think it just came to us. We did the same things we always
do. I got some good looks. Allan got some good looks. It was just regular, it
was our regular offense. It wasn't necessarily anything special we did.  
ALLAN RAY: I think we felt off our defense a little bit more in the second
half. We got into a flow offensively as a result of our defense.  
Q. With the No. 1 seed being knocked out, are you more encouraged, do you
have a better opportunity to win?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I know exactly what you're saying, but I don't want to think
about that at all. Because we made the point to our guys that everybody has
been talking about the UCONN-Villanova matchup, the third time. I told them if
we don't get by Rutgers, there is none. That happened today. I don't even want
to think about that yet. Of these two teams playing now, whoever we play, we
are going to have a battle. We haven't played Pitt, which is scary in itself.
The other guys, everybody knows.  
Q. In the grand scheme of things, what's going to happen in the next couple
weeks, how important is this tournament?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: This is, you know, if we said anything except this was
really important, we'd be lying to you. We love this. Basketball players,
everybody's from New York, Philly, DC, this is the BIG EAST, Madison Square
Garden. We love this. When you lose in this, you're crushed. You're crushed.
You just, you need some time to get over it. So, you know, the only good thing
was last year we played a great game against West Virginia and got beat so we
felt good about how we were playing. We were crushed that we got beat. This is
big, this is big.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
ALLAN RAY: Definitely. After watching UCONN lose, they was the No. 1 seed,
everyone realized anything can happen in these tournaments and you got to come
out ready to play. Most importantly you got to go out there and execute. So
that's one of the main focal points that we're trying to do here, is stay
focused and execute and make sure we take every game, game by game, not
looking ahead to any other game, you know. Just take it day by day.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, yeah (smiling). Are you telling me I talk too much?  
Q. I thought we'd have that conversation in private, but, really, did you
just do something like that, put the score up? Was had a conversation with
them?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: It was simple. We all came down to eat dinner together and
we just -- I just got up in front of them and said, "Hey, we just saw what
happened." I said, "Everyone's been talking about the matchup with UCONN, and
it's not going to happen now for them. If we don't beat Rutgers, it's not
going to happen. We don't have a chance at playing anybody either". We have to
answer your questions but to talk about all that is crazy. You're going to
play two very tough teams before you could ever get there.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You mean that it might shock that we only won it once?  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: You know, we always look at the history stuff after the
season. But during the season, whatever we're doing is paramount to us. Like
right now, this is the biggest thing in our lives and we're going to live it
every day, we're going to love it. And if we lose, we're going to be crushed
and then we're going to come back the next day.  
Yeah, if we won it, it would be great for Villanova. We would be psyched about
it for Villanova and then we'd concentrate on the NCAA tournament.  
Q. Will you allow yourself even a moment tonight to think the No. 1 team in
the country lost, you are No. 2?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, because I'll battle myself for that and I will battle
with them. That's what I fight with them about all the time. I won't let them
and if I think they're thinking it, I'll talk a lot, like Lenny says. I'll
keep talking to them until they stop thinking about it.  
Q. In the first half, was that a wakeup call?  
ALLAN RAY: Yeah, I think we didn't come out as aggressive on the defensive end
in the first half. You know, like Coach said, there was a lot of loose balls
Rutgers has beaten us to. A lot of hustle plays they were making, we were
always a step behind.  
You know, the second half, we just came out more aggressively on defense and
talking and playing together. 'Cause first half, we didn't really play
together out there.  
Q. Were you surprised about that?  
ALLAN RAY: I mean, it just happened, you know. Like, I could say we're a good
team and we just adjusted to it, you know. We just came out second half and
just played more aggressively.  
Q. This is kind of a follow-up of that question. First half they have a hot
shooter, kind of keeping them in the game. You come out in the second half.
How are you able to get the separation from them? It happened really
quickly.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Well, I think like Allan said, we were getting stops and
finally keeping it out of Quincy's hands a little bit. He was missing some
shots. Then, those shots turned into fast break opportunities for us. If the
first half we didn't get many because they were scoring and we were trading
baskets. We went on a little run there, we got some stops. Then he made two or
three plays in the row, tight game, now we were walking the ball up. I think
it was off our defense.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
ALLAN RAY: Yeah, we watched the game. We was in the hotel room laying up
watching the game.  
Q. So the game ends, did you think what?  
WILL SHERIDAN: Thought we had a game coming up. I mean, can't put too much
thought into it. We had to prepare for our own game. We really had to come out
and be focused against Rutgers. I mean, Rutgers is a great team. This is the
BIG EAST tournament, best conference in the country. We have to come out and
play our own game. We couldn't really worry about Connecticut.  
Q. Do you spend extra time working on your own shots during this particular
run?  
WILL SHERIDAN: I'm a ballplayer. I mean I put as much time into my game as
everyone else on the team. I mean, I work with all the coaches and, you know,
I do all the workouts. As a team, we work hard. I work just as hard as
everybody else on the team. I put a lot of team into my game.  
Q. What happened on the technical foul?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I don't want to talk about it. Just great official,
competitive guy, competitive coach, that's all. That's all.  
Q. Jay, you keep talking continually about taking it one guy at a time. How
do you keep your guys focused?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We really talk to them a lot about it. We really do. I think
it's the biggest challenge. All this media, everything around them, number two
in the country, it's a tough challenge. The most important thing is that
Allan, Randy, Bump (ph), our seniors, upper classmen, have been through this
before. They really control it from within. I'm always talking to these guys,
the captains, Allan and Randy all the time.  
Q. When you see Connecticut lose, did you need anyone to tell you to
focus?  
WILL SHERIDAN: No, I mean, like I said, we were focused for our game. We
didn't have -- Connecticut had, I would say, no effect on our game. We wanted
to come out and play our game and do what we wanted to do.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Will is one of the ones I don't have to worry about. He's
one of the ones, this is a whole other world over here. That's why I never
talk about him. What he says is true. The rest of them, I got to worry about.  
Q. Allan?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Answer this guy. He'll torment me. Answer him.  
ALLAN RAY: Only thing I can say --  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: He wants to know, did I need to tell you about it or was it
enough you watching?  
ALLAN RAY: I mean, we watched the game. We saw what happened. We were just
like, "Man, listen, the No. 1 team is out, you know. It could easily happen to
us. We got to go out there and play hard. We don't want to be the ones that's
going home." We worked too hard for it.  
WILL SHERIDAN: Just being honest.  
Q. Do you have any preference? Stupid question, has to be asked. You haven't
played Pitt yet, West Virginia beat you, you might want to get revenge.
Anything?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Not at all. Not at all.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [Quincy Douby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13741)

### [Anthony Farmer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13759)

### [Gary Waters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13739)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Coach Gary Waters and Quincy Douby. We will have Anthony
Farmer as well._  
COACH GARY WATERS: Okay, I'll make the first statement here. Number one, you
know, what I always do is give honor to God.  
Secondly, you know, you're playing a contest like this, you really don't feel
that you've completed everything, but I don't feel bad. I'm going to tell you
why.  
We have played three games in five days. That's NBA basketball. These guys, I
thought, played their heart out, especially in the first half of this game.
There were points in this game in the second half we were trying to do certain
things and I had players tell me, "Coach, I don't have any legs." That's hard
to do, especially when you're playing the No. 2 team in the country that
didn't play at all in the first part of the thing.  
So I really don't feel bad. I thought our kids did the best job they could
under the circumstances. After I evaluated this whole thing, I mean, if you
don't get a bye in that first round, it's tough. It's a tough, tough thing to
go through this thing.  
I think our guys played admirably. I thought Quincy was fabulous in the first
half. He kept us in there. I mean, without him, we're not in there and we
don't have a chance. But I think they ran out of gas.  
Questions, please.  
Q. In the second half, obviously they were able to get some separation. Were
they doing anything differently or do you think your guys, as you alluded to,
you might have hit a wall?  
COACH GARY WATERS: I think we hit a wall. I mean, I thought we were defending
pretty well in the first half on that, and I just think there was nothing
left. They outrebounded us on the glass, got the offensive rebounds, our guys
just weren't up there. You could see it, they weren't as quick to the ball as
they normally are. When I looked at that, think about it, we played Sunday on
the road against a team that probably no one thought we were going to beat on
the road there. That was one. Then we come back in and we play another team
that's rated, I mean that's going to the NCAA. We go, play another team. Then
we're playing the No. 2 team. That's kind of hard to do. I'm not trying to use
this as an excuse. It just dawned on me ten minutes ago. I'm upset we lost a
game, but at the same time, when I put it all together, you play three games
in five days. Put that in perspective, and you'll realize you've really played
some basketball. Our guys, you know, when you're playing only seven, eight
guys, that's hard on a bunch of guys.  
Q. You made it look easy getting your shot off in the first half, Quincy.
How frustrating was it that you were unable to get your looks later in the
game?  
QUINCY DOUBY: They did a better job second half, you know, double-teaming me,
triple-teaming me, trying to get the ball out of my hands, you know. They kind
of went to a three guard and zone with the big guys, just in case I beat my
man, so a guy could step up and get traps. And, you know, they did a good job
getting the ball out of my hands, making me take tough shots.  
Q. Did you have any gas in your tank at all in the second half?  
QUINCY DOUBY: Yeah, I thought I did. They did a good job, like I said. You
know, first half, you know, they kind of like let me get a little one-on-one
coverage and, you know, I took advantage of that, you know. I was getting in
the lane pretty easily. I was creating for guys.  
Second half, they just made it a lot more tougher for me. You know, they got
the ball out of my hands and I couldn't get it back in certain situations. You
know, it was just real tough. I got to give them a lot of credit.  
Q. Coach, are you pretty confident your phone's going to ring at some point
Sunday? Are there going to be anxious moments there?  
COACH GARY WATERS: I think the phone will ring. I mean, we're in the East. I
mean, they have to be pretty smart about that. They want people here at
Madison Square Garden. I think these kids deserve it, more so than anything
else. I think they deserve a call. I hope we're one of the first ones they
call, and I hope they give us a home game.  
Q. Quincy, will that be something positive? Is that something to be excited
about?  
QUINCY DOUBY: Yeah, 'cause we love playing basketball, you know. Whatever
tournament we could get in, you know, we just got to play hard and, you know,
just try to advance, try to win games, you know. We're not gonna just get in
it just to get in it, we're gonna try to advance and just have a good team.  
Q. Not ready to assess the season right now?  
QUINCY DOUBY: No, not at all.  
Q. Anthony, when did you feel that it got away from you all? What was it?
What changed?  
ANTHONY FARMER: I mean, in the second half, they got out on transition and got
some easy looks. I think that got them going. That kind of separated them in
the second half.  
Q. The final score, did it feel like that kind of game?  
ANTHONY FARMER: Actually, it didn't because, you know, I thought we were right
in there for a while. It started slipping away from us.  
But I think we played a real good game, you know. Unfortunately, things didn't
just work out.  
Q. With respect to teams you faced this year, are they the toughest team
because of what they put out guard-wise on the team? Are they the toughest
team you faced this year?  
ANTHONY FARMER: Definitely. They play hard. Their size doesn't matter. They
get in there, rebound. Playing with four quick guards like that, they're able
to recover. If you beat one of them, they're able to get back in front of you.
It's very difficult playing against those guys.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Pitt is here. Aaron Gray, Carl Krauser, Coach Jamie Dixon._  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Okay, great team. Obviously, we have five guys in double
figures. We had everybody step up. Obviously, the guys, we just talked to
Levon on the phone, he's back at the hotel and he was excited.  
Great effort. A lot of guys stepped up: Keith, Sam, John, gave us big minutes.
All those guys. But these two guys made a lot of big plays right next to me.
In rebounding, finding guys, Carl with six assists, directed traffic and did
all the things, played good defense. Aaron and Sam got the rebounds.  
Big key second half. We were even with them on the boards in the first half, I
think we were up one, we needed to take advantage and win the battle on the
boards and we clearly did that in the second half which was key and that's
what we had to do and that's what we really did.  
Took care of the ball. I thought we executed and really handled it. We did
something different as far as handling the 1-3-1, put in a little different
offense prior. I thought it was better for us. Put our guys in a little bit
better position. Executed at that end.  
But these two guys made all the plays, and I'm proud of them.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. (Inaudible) when you use the three guard lineup?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: We've done it all year long. We played those three guys
together. It's really not a surprise. We've done it often. I think it's a good
look for us. West Virginia is a little bit smaller, and play a little bit more
perimeter-oriented. So couple factors went into that.  
But we've done it before. We've played with it a lot. We practice with it.
Nothing really different. It worked well tonight.  
Q. Jamie and Carl, since you've never played Villanova, how often have you
seen them this season?  
CARL KRAUSER: We've seen them a lot. They've been on TV quite a bit now. We've
just been watching the three-guard offense. Sheridan and those guys do a great
job rebounding off of Allan Ray and those guys' misses. We're just gonna have
to stay solid, stay together, just move the ball around, find an open man and
just play Pitt basketball.  
Q. Can you talk about the mindset coming in, rebounding.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Well, it always is. That's what we do best, is rebounding,
it's what we worked on. It's a fundamental that we practice every day, preach,
we end drills. If you don't finish with a blockout you don't win the drill.
It's engrained in our heads. When we're only up one on the boards at half
time, that was the main thing. I think I said to you guys coming in at half
time, "we got to get it done on the boards". TO win it by 17, 18, the second
half, shows what these guys knew what we had to do to get it done and
responded.  
Q. How much do you think the energy of getting the start helped Sam for his
early production tonight? What's Levon's status for tomorrow?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Sam, you know, has played well. He's played well against
West Virginia, too, in the previous two games as well. He's been good all year
long. He finished well in the second half. We really got great passes from
Aaron a couple times. He's just good around the basket, offensive boards.
We're really trying to emphasize to him how great an offensive rebounder he
could be if he goes every single time. He's just a freshman getting better and
better, playing against seniors. That's why he's improved so much throughout
the year. He continues to get better.  
Levon, I don't think right now that he's going to be able to play. I mean, he
couldn't even stand up when we left. Back spasms. So I don't know how it's
going to be. He was with us, talked to him before the game, just talked to him
after the game. He's a big part of us. We need him, he's our best defender.
And he does a lot of great things for us. So we'll see.  
But he couldn't even get out of the bed. These back spasms happened once
before, earlier in the year. He missed some practices. We'll have to see how
he feels.  
Q. For both guys, because of the schedule, you don't get Villanova
throughout the regular season. How excited are you to face them, the No. 2
team in the country, and to face them in this setting now?  
AARON GRAY: You know, just another challenge. I mean, it's a great team. They
have a great coach, you know. They have great guards. You know, even their big
men have been starting to step up, Cunningham and Will Sheridan are great down
low.  
So, you know, it's just another challenge. A lot of people didn't think we'd
be where we're at. A lot of people were criticizing because of the way we
finished the season. They thought we could have came in here and been one and
done against Louisville. Just goes to show how tough this team is, how much we
believe in each other. You know, we went out there and we did that tonight
and, you know, even in the last minutes of the game, when it was a one-, two-
point game, no one gave up. No one had the thought in their mind that we
weren't going to win.  
As long as we keep that mindset and stay together, you know, this team can go
very far.  
CARL KRAUSER: I just think this is going to be another BIG EAST and another
tough, competitive game. Both teams are real competitive. Both teams have
great coaches. We all have great players and we just want to win and advance
to the championship round and in the BIG EAST tournament. I think it's going
to be a great, competitive game out here. It's going to be something to watch.  
Q. Aaron, you seem fatigued. Did that have anything to do with missing shots
early in the game?  
AARON GRAY: No. You know, I was fatigued, but it was only because I was
playing so hard, I thought anyways. Every time down the court, you know, I
felt that possession could be the possession whether we were going to win or
lose the game, you know.  
So, you know, obviously at the beginning of the game I wasn't fatigued. I just
wasn't being very effective around the basket. You know, that's something I'm
going to have to improve on, especially tomorrow. You know, playing against a
tough Villanova team.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
CARL KRAUSER: Oh, this is basketball, baby. I tell them, I look at them, I
tell them, This is basketball. This is what you've been doing all your life.
This is what you've been working hard for in the parks of New York. This is
what you love to do. So go out there, play basketball, play hard and have fun
at what you're doing. This is no pressure here. Where we come from is
pressure. Basketball is something you're supposed to enjoy, have fun, and
enjoy going out there and competing against somebody else.  
These guys come out here, they work hard, they believe in each other, and
they're great teammates.  
Q. You said you came up with a new way to attack the 1-3-1. When did you
install it? What was the idea behind it?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: It wasn't too much. I guess don't make too much out of it.
It was just a slight adjustment. We wanted to keep Aaron a little bit more
around the basket. We put in -- earlier in the week, as we always -- we always
add plays throughout the year, little adjustments. It wasn't too much. The
guys had to make the plays, make the passes, and that's what they did.  
And Aaron had the guard on the perimeter. Thinking about things, he had a
guard on the perimeter, guard at three-point shot with Pittsnogle, Kevin, then
rebound and do the things around the board. These are the guys that made the
adjustments, made the plays. We got smart guys. They can adjust. I'm finding
that out, too. This group can pick things up, we can add things, do different
things. They're young, as everybody knows, but they have good instincts and
they can pick things up and add things throughout the season. They feel real
comfortable doing that.  
Q. Carl, obviously, doesn't need any encouragement, but what do you tell the
guys, the rest of the team, to get them to buy into this playing tomorrow
night?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I don't think they even think that. I think they came here
thinking this was gonna be -- I know they didn't pack for a day, I'm sure of
that. You brought a lot of clothes, right, I'm sure.  
CARL KRAUSER: Definitely (laughing).  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, they love to play. I mean, I remember people were
making a big deal about playing on two -- having to play on the first night.
This conference, great teams are going to play on the first night. For our
guys, we would have been practicing anyway. They'd rather play than listen to
me at practice. So they'd rather do that. That's what they'd like to do. I
mean, I had to shorten the practice. They wanted to go the last practice we
had, they wanted to go longer. I had to pull them off. These guys love to
play. They've done that all fall. They did it in the summer. That's what they
like to do. So they'll be ready to go tomorrow.  
Q. Did you consciously not push too much in the second half, try to get
other people involved? When you did get involved, you seemed to be going to
the line. What was going on with Beilein?  
CARL KRAUSER: Oh, you know, me and Beilein are real good friends. We were just
talking a little trash out there. He was just telling me to miss the free
throws so I could help them out to try to win the game.  
But basically, you know, it was all in fun. It was a good, competitive game. I
just wanted to get the ball, knock down the free throws. When I was moving the
ball, I trust my teammates and I know those guys can make great plays. Levance
and Ronald, the rest of the guys on my team were making great plays. Antonio
Graves came in and made a big play off the bench. I mean, we just had an all-
around solid effort as a team. That's what we believe in, team effort.  
Q. Last year it was a one-and-out. You guys seem to win a lot when you play
in this tournament, on this floor. Why do you think you do so well here?  
CARL KRAUSER: First of all, a lot of guys on this team is from New York.
Second of all, like Coach said, we love to play basketball. I mean, there's
nothing else we'd rather do but play basketball. So having four games in four
days is just like a lot of fun.  
Having success on this floor, I mean, we all love to perform on a big stage,
and we all love to play with each other. So having a chance to play with these
guys again, coming back and enjoying these wins, is just, you know, a
blessing. It's a blessing. It's a lot of fun to come back here and play
basketball.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Dominic James, Steve Novak, Coach Tom Crean._  
COACH TOM CREAN: Well, much like every other game that's been here, this week
ours was a great basketball game, exciting finish. Proud of the way our guys
continued to hold in there, battle back with the deficit. I think that's part
of the growth process of a young team really growing up, even though we
weren't able to finish it off, that we never got down and we kept trying to
come back.  
As I said to the team after the game, games like this never come down to the
last possession or last two possessions; they always come back to something
inside of the game. It wasn't our best day for guarding back cuts. It wasn't
our best day for blocking out. It wasn't our best day for guarding
penetration.  
I thought as far as transition defense and things of that nature, we did a
good job. Georgetown deserves a lot of credit for the way that they played
offensively and defensively. Everything that we got, they made us earn it.
Outside of the layups they got and the back cuts, I think we made them earn a
lot.  
But a lot of credit goes to them for the way they played and their players,
their coaches. They're an excellent team and one that's going to be a real
factor starting next week.  
As far as us, this was a new experience not only for Marquette to be at the
BIG EAST tournament, but a new experience for a lot of young guys that mean a
lot to our program to play under this kind of scrutiny and under this kind of
atmosphere. Hopefully, we will learn what it's like again to play in something
like this. Hopefully, that will benefit us as we go into next week into the
tournament as well. These guys have responded all year and gotten better, and
I don't have any reason to believe that they won't next week.  
Q. There were only maybe three or four possessions on Georgetown where you
had got them off of their end of the floor. Can you talk about their ability
to keep the ball on their end of the floor.  
COACH TOM CREAN: I think their length was somewhat of a factor. But, again, I
think it was - I'll have to watch the tape on this for sure - but I don't
think we were as physical on the blockouts as we needed to be. We were earlier
and we weren't as good late with that.  
But they've got great length, you know. Whether it's in the guard position or
the forward position, they've got it. It's very, very hard to come back on
this team. That's why they're going to be such a factor in the NCAA
tournament. Once they get up, it becomes a great challenge to come back.  
Fortunately, we were able to. Some things went our way, when we got down
seven, got down eight, to come back and get in it. But it's going to be really
hard for people to do that. They really know how to play with a lead.  
Again, we gave them a few too many opportunities. As hard as we played, as
much effort as we gave, we definitely, you know, allowed them to do some
things that we hadn't planned on, you know, that we practiced against. That's
part of the growth process for us, but it also is more important about the way
they executed. They wait till they get what they want, and they're very good
at that.  
Q. Coach, when Jerel misses that last shot at the end, you went right to
half court before you shook hands with anybody. What did you say?  
COACH TOM CREAN: You know, he's my guy, he's our guy. I mean, we wouldn't be
in New York without guys like Steve and Dominic and Jerel and this whole
group. So, you know, he took a shot, he'll take it again and he'll make it,
you know. Just his freshman year, Travis Deaner against Tulsa in the NCAA
tournament, he misses a three at the end of the game. I told him, "You'll make
that shot a lot more than you'll miss it." I believe the same thing with
Jerel. A week ago Dominic hits a shot like that to send it into overtime at
Louisville.  
I'm very proud of our effort, I'm very proud of him and the way that he's
played the entire season. Now we go home and get better.  
Q. Man-to-man defense, they took advantage of a lot of things that defense
allows. How difficult is it as a coach to go zone?  
COACH TOM CREAN: We zoned them when we played them a few weeks ago at
Marquette, and we had some success with it. We wanted to mix defenses tonight.
There were times we were really good with that and there were times we
weren't. The thing that hurt us outside of some of the put-backs they got, a
couple of the postups, we're really better than to be giving up those layups.
We work really hard to take away the back cuts and we didn't do a good job of
that today. They did a great job of executing. It wasn't just the man that,
you know, the back door was ran on, it was the ball pressure.  
We had a lot more success against it at our place. Tonight, we let down a
little bit with ball pressure on those back cuts.  
But I believe, you know, these guys, whether we're man, zone, whatever we're
doing, we've been good at both. So it's just a matter of us really, you know,
just being able to never relax. That's the whole key to playing a team like
Georgetown. When you relax, they take advantage of it. Not relax like you're
trying to catch a break. But when you're out of position even the least little
bit, they know how to take advantage of that. That's what they did a couple
times to us.  
Q. Dominic, did you feel like pressing a little bit after (inaudible)?  
DOMINIC JAMES: I mean, Coach just told me to maintain my aggressiveness, just
keep going to the basket; shots like that were going to fall for me. But he
didn't want me to stop my aggressiveness, continue to go to the basket. But
when I got to the basket, look for my shooter. That's what I was trying to do.
Shots weren't falling for me early on.  
Just like Coach told me, I just tried to maintain my aggressiveness and try to
find my open man. I got better at that toward the end of the game.  
COACH TOM CREAN: I would have taken him out of the game if he would have
stopped playing his way, shooting the ball. Same thing with Steve. We're not
in these positions if those guys aren't making plays for us. You know, what I
can relate now in my experiences of being a coach, four years ago we go to
Cincinnati, we play Louisville, we qualify for a bye, we play Louisville the
next day and a guy named Dwyane Wade had a real struggle in the first half,
and sometimes in the second half. It took a layup -- well, it took a dunk off
a play to kind of break that ice for him. From then on, the rest is kind of
history. He just kind of relaxed and played.  
Everybody goes through it. Everybody goes through it. It's part of having a
young team, it's part of having guys that have the ball in their hands a lot.
It's part of the respect factor that the other teams have for these guys. They
know they can play and they're going to do a great job to defend it.  
I thought Dominic in the second half did a great job of delivering the ball,
moving the ball, continuing to penetrate, and at the same time he was a focal
point of our offense, but he continued to move it to other people. That's all
you can ask. Are you getting better inside of the game?  
And outside of some back cuts today and some blockouts, I thought we did. But
give Georgetown credit, they defended at a high level as well. You look at the
numbers: It's 41% for Georgetown, 40% for us from the field, 39% from the
three for us, 20% for the three for then. It was a defensive game; they just
got a few more easy baskets than we did. I think that's really what it came
down to, more layups. That's what happens. That's where teams win this time of
year, the teams get the most easy baskets. We have to go home and keep
figuring out how to get more of them ourselves.  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH TOM CREAN: Well, they throw so many bounce passes. Again, you know,
defense all starts with the ball pressure. Defending the back cuts all starts
with the ball pressure. Your weak side help has got to be good. If you're not
pressuring the ball, it makes it that much harder. We didn't do a great job of
snapping our head, getting our hand low, things we did the first time, things
that have been important for us in our defense. They read that and did a good
job of it.  
Q. Steve, obviously, final seconds you had no choice but to commit the foul.
As well as you were shooting down the stretch, how frustrating was it not to
be on the floor at that moment?  
STEVE NOVAK: Yeah, well, in that situation I knew we had to foul. We didn't
have enough time. I wasn't nervous. I really had the confidence those guys
were going to get it done and make a great play. Just like Coach said, last
week Dominic was the guy who hit the shot. I have definitely confidence in
those guys to execute and run the play.  
I didn't get a bad look. I think Dominic drew some attention and gave it to
Jerel like he always does. Like Coach said, I think if Jerel gets that shot
again, he'll knock it down.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH TOM CREAN: I would say the first half it wasn't great. We probably, you
know -- when we made the next pass, it was pretty good, but we wanted to drive
the ball. And, again, at half time it was 22-all, I believe, right? So there's
going to be times that your shot's not falling, there really is. I don't think
-- we had a couple shots we probably would take back, but for the most part,
we just missed some shots.  
At the same time, we were going back on the other end and we were defending as
well. That's really hard to do. You build your confidence and you build your
momentum from your offense a lot of times, okay, because that comes from the
execution. But you've still got to be able to go back down the floor and
guard. First half, we did that. Second half, it was kind of a mix-and-match.
We never were able to get our running game going really the way we wanted to
over the long haul. That's a credit to their transition defense.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
STEVE NOVAK: I think he played a great game. I know he was one of our more
aggressive guys out there. I think that we got to the line by doing that. Made
some big free throws middle of the game, at the end of the game, with
pressure. That's a huge credit to him.  
I think he kept us in it for a while with his aggressiveness. You know, Coach
was preaching that before the game, was that one of our guards is going to be
able to fly and get rebounds. I think Wesley believed that he could do that,
and went in there and did a good job doing it.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
DOMINIC JAMES: No. I mean, (inaudible) and as a point guard, other guys are
open. I mean, I was just trying to have tunnel vision. It wasn't that I was
going to take the last shot, if I had that kind of mindset or anything like
that. I was just going to find an open man, which I feel like I'm good at
doing. At the time, that was Jerel. I feel like he got a good look at the
basket. Unfortunately, it didn't go in.  
But just like Coach and Steve said, we got a lot of confidence in every single
player that's out there on the floor. If I had to give the ball to Jerel
again, then I had the confidence to give it to him again because I got to
trust that he hits the shots.  
COACH TOM CREAN: Everybody on the floor at the end was a threat to make the
shot if they got the ball. I thought Dominic -- they did a good job of turning
him one time, which, you know, when you're playing with seconds like we are,
there's always a factor. They did a good job of covering him. Rather than
force the shot, he delivered the ball, and it just didn't go.  
But I thought he made -- he read the defense as well as could possibly be, you
know, in the end of the game situation like that.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
STEVE NOVAK: I don't think -- I doubt they switched anything there. Kind of
changed things up a little bit during the game. But for the most part they had
just been I think just kind of switching everything. I think those were more
just kind of we were just playing. I mean, those shots weren't any set plays.
We were just kind of playing out of our offense. Some guys made some good
plays. I think one of them, Chris just saw my guy and just screened him. Swung
the ball over to him.  
I think we were just playing out of our offense on those.

### [Jeff Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15561)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Jeff Green and Brandon Bowman with Coach John Thompson III._  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I said yesterday, any win in March is good. We hung
in there. That's a very good team. They force you to figure it out, they force
you to think, they tweak and they change and they do so many different things.
I thought our guys did a good job, while we were in the court, of trying to
figure out the best way to attack what they were doing, of not getting
panicked and of sticking with our stuff. Eventually, we settled into a rhythm.  
Q. Can you talk about Brandon again, eight straight free throws down the
stretch.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: And he got a couple of big rebounds, too, and a
couple of big deflections. Took him a couple balls loose, steals down the
other end.  
I thought he was very good again for the same reasons as yesterday. You make
your free throws, come up with loose balls, get big rebounds. I thought he was
terrific at doing the things that help you to win. As I said, same thing I
said yesterday, people have a tendency just to look at points, but Brandon did
all the things in the game today to help us win. And he made his foul shots.  
Q. Maybe the third or fourth time you guys have been shaky with the margin
down the stretch. Pittsburgh, Duke. It seems like that's a very...  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Come out on top. Yeah, I mean, we have to tighten up
a few things. They made some very good plays, you know. A couple times with
the press they got some key turnovers. It happens. Once we got the ball in, we
held on to it, we made our foul shots.  
Q. Brandon, what did you do differently tonight that forced them out of that
man to man and you created some offensive opportunities?  
BRANDON BOWMAN: We were putting the ball in the hole today. I mean, we hit
some key shots down towards the end, kind of stretched the zone a little bit.
We let Jeff go to work down there. By stretching it out, by keeping everyone
else on the outside, you know, Jeff got some good post moves down there,
couple (inaudible) ones. It made him go man.  
I mean, after that, it's pretty much what we do, back door cuts, you know, hit
threes, you know.  
Q. You were talking to Jeff. When they went man, I mean, against this team,
that's been a real recipe for disaster, the way you played this year. When
they went man, did your eyes light up?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We felt that if we can get them to a point where they
were chasing us, man or zone, we could have some success. We got them out of
the zone because we had that working margin, and most possessions, I thought
our offense looked pretty good. Our guys did a good job of cutting and looking
for every option within our offense.  
Did our eyes light up? I'm not sure about that. They're too good of a team,
they're too well-coached and they're too poised to say our eyes lit up. At the
same time, we felt if we could get them to go man, we could get some easy
baskets.  
JEFF GREEN: Well, stuff was just open. We made hard cuts. Like Coach said, we
had them chasing us. The back door was open and we just made some key plays
down the stretch.  
Q. Looking back to the first time you played Syracuse, what was the key in
that game? Did you see any part of that game playing out?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: You know, even though it was, what, a week ago, I
don't know how long, two weeks ago, it wasn't that long ago, it's different.
I'm sure that they're going to go and they're going to make adjustments. We're
going to see some things we can do better, we can do differently, we're going
to make adjustments. You can't look at that and say, "Okay, that's the
blueprint, let's duplicate what we did then and they're going to duplicate
what they did." We just have to come ready to play. Obviously, they're playing
very well right now. Obviously, they're a poised team playing with a purpose.  
I don't anticipate that game, you know, the way we try to attack things or the
way they try to attack us, you know, I don't think it's going to be the exact
same carbon copy. Obviously, we're going to go back, look at it, see some
things that we did well and see some things that we need to improve on.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I tell you what, every time -- I agree with you. When
he takes it, it's going in. Steve Novak is terrific. We try to be attentive to
where he was, we try to make sure we're jumping out and switching out hard on
him. If you relax just for a second, it doesn't matter where he is on the
floor, it's going in. He does not need space. Like you said, we do a good job
for 16 minutes and then all of a sudden for 4 he goes off. That's what good
players do, and he's a good player.  
Q. I know you haven't had much of a chance to digest what's to come tomorrow
night. Obviously it's an old-school BIG EAST matchup. What does it mean for
you to be going up against Coach Boeheim?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: It's Georgetown-Syracuse in The Garden. That says it
all if anybody knows anything about the history of this league. We'll see what
happens once we throw it up tomorrow.  
Q. Ashanti made two three-point shots today. It seemed to come where the
other side (inaudible). He did that at least once yesterday, too. Does he look
to see that shot when it seems like there's momentum?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We have different guys all year that have been able
and have stepped up and done that. Without a doubt, Ashanti had the ball in
his hands and hit a couple of key, big long shots today. He did the same thing
-- he did the same thing yesterday. As I said about Brandon yesterday, Ashanti
is a senior. Ashanti is a senior that's playing, that understands what we're
playing for, what he's playing for right now.  
But we have confidence, I have confidence, our team has confidence in anyone
who has the ball in that situation. He just happened to have it. He, as
expected, as I expect for all of our guys, stepped up and made it.  
Q. Can you talk in general about how the team has responded. After coming
here, there was a little bit of disappointment. Your best players are playing
Did their best.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: You know, I don't know whether we needed to prove
anything or get anything back. As I said to these guys, and I may have said it
to you, it's March. This time of year, you can't dwell on that South Florida
game, you know. It was a bad loss. We needed to go, move on. We can't dwell on
it because the next game is so crucial, the next game is urgent.  
And, you know, I think that, you know, we're doing what we need to do. Our
guys need to keep relying on each other, keep having faith in each other, and
keep working hard. We'll see what happens tomorrow.  
Q. With these two wins, how much does this help you guys now to get the look
at the tournament coming up? I know you still have this to deal with. How much
does this cement what you've accomplished?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: That's too big-picture for me. I don't think big-
picture. You know, we'll figure that out once this tournament is over, we'll
start thinking about the NCAA - hopefully, the NCAA tournament.  
But right now, it's not time to sit back and say, "Oooh, look at what these
two wins did." Hopefully, we're sitting here on Saturday saying, "Look what
these four wins do." That's what we want to do.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: First of all, I want to start off with a profound abject
apology for my language yesterday. I'd like to double what I said but take
away those words.  
Second thing is I'll tell you, when it got to -- we caught Connecticut a
little down and got out. But when they caught us, and they caught us a lot, we
kept going. We'd get going. They caught us three or four times. Usually, when
that happens, you're kind of go away a little bit, but these guys wouldn't let
it go away. Gerry wouldn't let it go away. He was playing on about half a leg
today but, you know, he amazes me every time I see him play. He's got more
guts than anybody I've ever coached. The other freshmen here has a lot of
them, too.  
Our whole team, at the end we're going with 6-3, 6-3. Connecticut is a great
team. We caught them a little bit early, but then once they got going, we just
played well. I thought we isolated and ran our offense the best that we've run
it all year. Except for we have to learn about taking the ball out of bounds
because we made the same mistake tonight. We gave them four points at the end
of that game where we could have had the lead in regulation.  
When Gerry got the ball coming down, set something up, I told him to drive and
throw it to one of three guys at the end of regulation. He looked at me and
said, "Can I shoot it?" I said, "They're not gonna let you shoot it. But if
they do, shoot it" (laughter). As soon as he released it, there was never a
doubt that ball was nothing but net.  
But going to overtime, I still would feel the odds were all against us. But
these guys just would not, they would not back off.  
The thing with Connecticut, you know, I've already told Mike, we're going to
play our home game here next year (laughter). We can't beat them any place
else, you know. They've killed us four straight games except for the two here.  
I think it helps you a little bit - a little bit - to play that first night.
You kind of get going. But the guts these guys had, our five starters played
36 minutes last night and they came back and had to play pretty close to the
same thing tonight. I just think that's amazing to me that they could play
that many minutes.  
It's a great win. I'd say it's one of the best, if not the best, that we've
ever had at Syracuse. That's over -- I've only been there, though, 44 years so
I don't know. I can't remember Vic Hansen's games. But for us, this is it.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Gerry, it seemed obvious you wanted the ball on the next to last
possession. Can you talk about that possession and wanting to take the shot
after that.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Yeah, I wanted to take the shot but I thought Josh Wright and
Eric were as good candidates as any. I thought Josh got a good shot. I thought
he probably got a 12-, 13-, 14-footer. He put a good shot up there. It was
soft. Even though he missed it, we still had a chance to rebound it. I thought
the possession was quality but at the same time I want to take every last
second shot.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He missed two in a row, I wanted to try somebody else.  
Like any out-of-bounds play, we threw it to Mooky because we knew he was going
to make a free-throw.  
Q. How would you compare last night's shot with today's?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: I said yesterday's shot and the certain situation and under
the circumstances was the most important, but I'd have to change that to
tonight, or today.  
We needed it, and like Coach said, I've been around great players and great
teams, and there's no doubt we've struggled at times this year. I'm more proud
of this team with the way we came in here these last two games and won than
any team I've played on just because we could have laid over, came down here,
just laid up an egg and we hadn't. We came in here with a purpose, and what we
did today was pretty special because we think very highly of Connecticut.  
Q. Gerry, were you surprised that you were able to get the ball?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: I wasn't surprised I was able to get the ball. The thing was,
is I stopped pretty far out. I think that's why it mixed them up a little bit.
I took the shot early just in case I did miss it, we had a chance for a
tipout. I did that. I think Rashad Anderson was on me. I stopped really early.
I think that might have threw them off a little bit. I stopped, I think behind
the NBA line. I did it quick. That's the way I wanted to do it because I
wanted to get the shot off clean. I think that might have threw them off a
little bit.  
But I'm a little surprised that I got the ball. I caught it pretty deep. I
caught it about three-quarters of court. Yeah, I am a little surprised.  
Q. Gerry, throughout your career against Connecticut you've had some
struggles. Does this game make up for all those difficult times in the past?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, there's no doubt that defensively they play me better
than anyone. They're incredible. I think they may be No. 1 in the nation, in
opponent field goal percentage, I think they're up there.  
I mean, there's no secret why they win games. They're great on defense, they
have great athletes and great offensive players. When you have both of those
going for you, it's tough to beat them. They've played great on me. They've
been there on every catch, they hedge me on ball screens. I've had a difficult
time. In the first half I just tried to get everyone involved and it worked.  
Q. Assuming this win gets you in the field for the Big Dance, and obviously
it should have, is there an exhale now or are you thinking of defending your
championship here?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: No, we play one game at a time at Syracuse. We're going to
try to come out tomorrow. Whoever we play, it's a great team. You know, we're
just going to try to come out and play, you know. We didn't need to win it
last year and we won it. We're going to try to, you know, win tomorrow and go
from there.  
Q. For Eric and Gerry, can you talk about the last possessions for
Connecticut. Marcus got a good look.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Our defensive specialist.  
ERIC DEVENDORF: Oh, yeah.  
Well, Coach had been telling me all year that I been struggling on defense,
which I have. But I think today I played pretty well on defense, and I was
keeping people in front of me. That's all I tried to do on the last play
against Marcus. Obviously, he got an open look, but I'm just glad it didn't go
in.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: I think one thing you have to add is Marcus is extremely
talented at finding his teammates. One of the things he does so well is get in
the lane and create for other people. He did a good job of shooting it. I
think no one else would have got a better shot, because he got in the middle
and everyone went out to everyone else. I think that's where he was so
intelligent. He put up a good shot just like Josh did and it just didn't go
down.  
He made a great play. I don't think it was lack of defense. I think it was an
intelligent play on his part.  
Q. Coach, the passing of Gerry and Eric in the first half.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, we wanted to, believe it or not, we were holding the
ball. Doesn't really look like that, but we were trying to hold the ball if we
didn't have a transition. We got 14, 16 points in transition, which we wanted
to take but when we didn't have that, we wanted to spread them out. They've
been doubling Gerry on the pick and roll so we wanted to get that set wide so
we could go back to the guy. Terrence made a couple big plays off that, Mooky
got a dunk off that.  
Then we wanted to try to have a little more patience and make them play
defense. They pressure so much that we wanted to spread them out and try to
get Gerry into the lane with the ball rather than looking to shoot the three.
The more he got in the lane, the more they're going to come and help, and our
big guys are looking more for the ball and finishing plays inside. That's the
difference really with our team, in these two games and in the season. We've
really been a perimeter team and we haven't been able to get in the lane and
get our big guys involved. We've been able to get our big guys involved and
Demetris came up tonight. We've needed him, we've missed him for a while. He
stepped up big tonight. The jumper he made in the lane was huge. He just got
out in transition and battled all day on defense. We need him to be there, and
he was there big-time for us tonight.  
Q. Demetris, in the first games against Connecticut they got off to such a
big lead. You got off to a big lead today. How much confidence did that give
you that you could beat these guys?  
DEMETRIS NICHOLS: That gave me a confidence and I think it gave the team
confidence, you know. We all thought that we could beat them, you know. Nobody
really had faith in us or hope in us, you know, so we kind of had a chip on
our shoulder a little bit. We just go over there and we just tried to leave it
out on the court, you know, and just play great defense because that was going
to determine the game.  
Q. Can you talk about the contributions you got from guys like Josh and
Arinze?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Josh was tremendous. I didn't hesitate at all at the end.
He was supposed to drive the ball in the lane and if he couldn't get there
then kick it out to Gerry or Eric. But he got there. I told him in the locker
room, "I'll take that shot every time". He made that floater earlier. He makes
that shot, I'll take that shot every time.  
I thought he was very good today. I thought he really did a nice job. I
thought Louie battled. He had six rebounds. I just thought he battled hard the
whole time.  
We got out-rebounded, we had more turnovers. They only turned over 11 times
and shot the heck out of the ball from the free throw line. I mean, it was --
this was -- we had to overcome a lot of things out there today, and it was a
tremendous accomplishment.  
But those two guys that you mentioned, Arinze did a nice job for a couple
minutes in there, got a couple rebounds. But I just thought, I'm very proud of
these guys. This was some effort today.  
Q. Gerry, after the game your Coach said on ESPN you played with half a leg.
How healthy are you today, and going forward how are you feeling?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, I had an injury earlier in the season. It kind of
lingered with the groin. But it's been easier for me to play during the
regular season because of breaks. Coming down here, we were a little worried
if we kept advancing how my body would recover just because I've never given
it a chance to heal fully.  
Now I got a couple treatments. I felt good. I think, you know, Coach and I
talked about it, and Mike Hopkins, the assistant, we talked before the game
about having a game plan and picking my spots, when to be aggressive, when not
to be, when to get in and out of the game. In the first half, we were in and
out. I was in and out of the game in the first half. Coach did a good job of
getting me a quick one-, two-minute rest then get me back in there.  
That's really what it came down to. In the second half I had fresh legs
because in the first half I was alternating time with Josh Wright and Eric and
Louie.  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: The thing is he never even hesitated. That's what bad. He
didn't even think about it.  
ERIC DEVENDORF: Yeah, what Coach said.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I should have gotten a time-out, should have run and got
the time-out. We had one left.  
ERIC DEVENDORF: But, no, I mean, I was just trying to make a defensive play.
Obviously, I made a dumb decision to go up. But it slipped out of my hands,
but really I just should have took the ball out and made him foul me.  
But, I mean, we won the game.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: The interesting thing is Denham Brown made an unbelievable
three in the corner against us, five-point game and 28 seconds. That was an
unbelievably tough three over there.  
But that's what they -- they never -- they came back every time. They came
back ten different times. We had them down, they came back. When they took the
lead in overtime, we were able to still come back. That says a lot about this
team.  
Q. Such an incredible game. Does it add something special since it's against
Coach Calhoun?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: No, we obviously needed the game. They're the No. 1 team in
the country. If you can beat the No. 1 team in the country, it could be
anybody. I mean, it's just a huge win for us. Everybody knows we came in here
struggling and, you know, last two or three games. (Inaudible) keeps saying we
only won four out of our last thirteen when it was five out of our last ten.
He keeps saying that. He never was very good in math anyway.  
But I guess now we won six out of our last ten or something.  
This was, you know, obviously, we said it already, you beat the No. 1 team in
the country, that's pretty good. They're rested. So, yeah, this is a huge win
for us.  
Thanks.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2006

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [J.D. Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13762)

### [Kevin Pittsnogle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13763)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Pitt has a terrific defensive team. I admire the way they
play, how hard they play, how smart they play defensively. I thought we had
some good opportunities. We missed some easy ones and then made some tough
ones.  
But their quickness and their just great offensive rebounding was a big
difference in the game.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. What was wrong with Mike Gansey coming down the stretch?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: When he dove for the ball, I think it was, what, the
10-minute mark, 8-minute mark, something, he ended up getting stomach cramps.
Something cramped up in his stomach, and he couldn't do much after that.  
Q. When you look at a game like this, a really close game until the end, was
the rebounding --  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, you know what, yeah, in the first half our zone
defense and our man were both very good. In the second half, you know, Gray
just stayed really close to the basket. Kevin was out giving a lot of help and
he just gets great possession. He's a big, big guy. Sam Young as well, having
the 11 rebounds. I think he had several offensive, too.  
Just two guys who traditionally get outrebounded like that, and just had a
couple of extra possessions that were very important for them. We didn't get
them to turn it over the way we did the prior two times we played them.  
Q. Each of the players, can you address the run you were able to make here
last year. It established you as a solid team. This year you came in a little
bit different, not as hot as you were last year. Is it disappointing to be
one-and-done?  
KEVIN PITTSNOGLE: I think it was a little disappointing to come in and get a
loss the first game, the bye and stuff. I mean, we worked hard all season to
get what we got, that was the bye. To come in and get a loss, it's kind of
disappointing.  
But right now we just have to get ready for practice and get ready for the
NCAA, whoever we play, and hopefully make a little run again like last year.  
J.D. COLLINS: Like Kevin said, it's very disappointing. We planned on staying
a little longer than this. We have to tip our hats to Pitt. They did a great
job of just rebounding, going after it, playing tough defense. We just got to
bounce back and get ready for our next game.  
Q. John, can you talk a little bit about last year you came out here so hot.
This year you're going into a tournament losing five out of seven. Talk about
the difference.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Well, I think that we ended up playing really very well
here. I think we lost five out of seven because we were playing lights-out
teams, most of them on the road. I think our only home loss was to UCONN by a
couple so sometimes it's a matter of the schedule.  
I thought in our last three games - Cincinnati, Pitt and Louisville - we were
playing as well as we had played all year.  
But for whatever reasons, you know, we could not make some of the shots we
made last year. I think we shot 40% throughout this whole tournament. We only
shot 33 today. It was a bad matchup for us as far as quickness on the
perimeter today. They got in the lane much too often. We had to give help and
give up rebounding.  
Q. You're not particularly concerned?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I mean, I've been concerned all year that we weren't as
athletic as we were last year. D'or Fischer and Tyrone Sally are very quick,
very good defensive players. Any time we lose, I'm concerned.  
But we played a very difficult schedule. We came in here. We're probably the
only 3 seed in the country that played a team that was 6 seed that was higher
rated than us in the nation. It wasn't like we came in here and lost to
Cupcake U; this was a heck of a team we just lost to that I think had a
tremendous season. There's a reason why they're nationally ranked and ahead of
us in both RPI and the rankings.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Well, it certainly was one of the more disappointing losses
we've had in an awful long time, mainly because you got off to such a poor
start. We got off to a start where we played like a team that had a 25-point
lead at the Carrier Dome and then beat a team by 23 at our place and they were
just going to play. Plus, secondly, I've always said about the bye, it takes
you usually 10 minutes to get going; it took us 25 minutes to get going. I
don't think we played any basketball.  
By the way, there is some good news. Some of the guys -- a couple of the guys
in our States, from our columns, can now write about us. We won a championship
on Saturday, they wrote about horse racing or GHO. The only thing I feel good
about, some of those columnists who haven't wrote about us the past couple
days, they've been writing about everything else, they said they were only
going to write about us when we lost. Now you can write, which I feel very
good about.  
So with that said -- and, by the way, that's a true statement. It's not
bullshit. They said that: "We'll write about him when he loses." So now you
got a chance to write.  
We came out flat as heck. Syracuse, just as we thought, that shot yesterday
carried their momentum right into the game, and they played terrific. They
took it right to us. We were the team that looked slow. We were the team that
looked like it couldn't attack a zone.  
At half time, we tried to appeal to the kids that this was not the same team
that had played all year. We were not -- we were -- the word "unselfish,"
which I said on Saturday, was not the case today. It wasn't just selfish, we
just didn't have any idea of who each other was, of how to attack this zone
that we had played now in the past two years, you know, we've played six
times. This is our sixth game with Syracuse, and we've had some moderate
success with it. And, yet, we still didn't look like we did anything.  
At half time I think we started to regroup. They countered. Then we got
ourselves back, three-point lead with 11 seconds to go, and made a decision.
We talked a great deal about who to play him. We put Denham -- I'm sorry,
Rashad on him. You know, he was able to get to the top of the key and shoot
the basket.  
We were going to follow him in the six- to five-second range, but he had such
an easy route all the way to the top of the key and he did a good job of
getting free. I have to look at the tape, but Rashad might have lost him a
little bit. But went right to the top of the key, shot it, and that was
overtime then. We fought back in overtime and were unable to win.  
But my congratulations to Jimmy. Obviously, they're a tournament team. I
thought they were a tournament team yesterday. They did a great, great job.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Jim, generally when you guys make a comeback like you did in the second
half, down 14, and you get the momentum rolling, you're usually able to open
up some space. Are you surprised that didn't happen today?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I don't remember the last time - and I'm sure it has been -
that we've lost a game with eleven seconds to go, up three. We'll go with the
kids, and I make the decisions, I'm the one who decides who plays who and I'll
live with that. He's been a great player for us. It could have been anybody.
Just so happened Gerry made a better play and made a giant three. Gerry, up to
that point, was two for nine from three so, you know...  
But he's a clutch player, as Jimmy said. If he's "overrated," I want to, you
know -- he's going to try to find a way to beat you. He's a terrific
basketball player.  
But generally speaking, you're right, when we do get the momentum. But I give
credit to Syracuse. When we came back at them, Jimmy went to something I
haven't seen Jim do in an awful lot of years - a lot of years. He went to a
spread offense outside and just took time off. They were able to get by us on
a number of occasions. It really was a good strategy because they were playing
with a lead, they were playing with house money, and they were able to take
time off the clock and did a great job of managing the clock.  
As I said, this one, we're going home. We're going home this afternoon. We
were going to stay around tonight, and I said, Nope, we're going home and
we'll probably have a day or two off and get ourselves ready.  
I know personally I can't be more disappointed for these kids and the way they
fought back and then lost the game and got beat really by Gerry's shot.  
I mean, the overtime happened. Five minutes, you can play anybody for five
minutes. But for 40 minutes, usually the better team wins. Maybe we were equal
teams today. I don't know about that. But I think with 11 seconds, we've been
pretty good with 11 seconds normally.  
We're very disappointed. It's not Rashad's fault, trust me. Whatever we ask
our kids to do - whatever we ask our kids to do - it's our responsibility. We
make the choice of who plays who. We thought he had done such a good job on
him, so...  
You know, whether we had put Hilton on him, said, "Hilton, you have to play
him full court, make him try to shoot over you, try to make him go to the
basket," whatever the case may be, once again, that's our call.  
I'm proud of the way the kids came back. I'm incredibly, incredibly
disappointed in the loss, incredibly disappointed in myself. I would have
changed a couple things probably last two, three minutes of the game and into
overtime. But, otherwise, we'll go home at 27-3, give some people a chance to
write, which is always good, you know - although I do fear a lot more trees
will be falling this week because of that and apprentice ink will be printed -
but it gives them a chance to write. Winning a Championship, the 10th, the
most in BIG EAST history, and then we talked about the GHO that day. I don't
know why. I guess it was a good day to put it in there. But I thought winning
the Championship against a really good Louisville home, you know, it could be
mentioned. Our beat writers, who have done a great job all year, they
mentioned it. Some of the columnists aside. But other guys said, "We're going
to write when he loses." I've lost.  
I'm sorry. I digress.  
Q. Denham, can you talk about that three-pointer that you hit down the
stretch there.  
DENHAM BROWN: You know, down a couple baskets. You know, shot it. Went in, you
know.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: You know, Denham and all the kids down the stretch - and,
by the way, kind of talking, picking up on what you had said - Syracuse and us
were matching daggers after each other. It was a heck of a game. Just that
when you lose, the rawness of it hurts, especially when you're down. And for
Jimmy, with the big lead early, it would have hurt just as bad. Trust me. It
would have. That was the kind of game when we got down to the end, both teams
just kept matching each other. You mentioned not pulling away. Denham's big
hoops, big hoops by Rudy. I mean, all the various plays that happened during
the game made whoever was going to lose that game so proud of their kids
because they came back. Because you know what, rankings and polls and seeds
and all that stuff, in the midst of a game, they don't count. You know, you
got to make shots. You got to get rebounds. You got to play defense. So in the
midst of a game, I thought both teams just made some fabulous, fabulous plays,
and ended up being a fabulous game that is very raw with me right now because
I felt so badly that our kids lost.  
But if anybody was going to beat me, I guess a good friend Jim, really got his
team to play well after having three poor games at the end of the season. He's
had two great wins here in the tournament.  
Q. Marcus, can you talk about the last final seconds in overtime, the shot
you took. Did it feel good?  
MARCUS WILLIAMS: The last shot, split the double team. Had an open look. Just
didn't fall.  
Q. Jim, in your experience do you find there's a correlation between the way
the team plays in a conference tournament --  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Well, last year Syracuse won and lost in the first round to
Vermont. The question was simply, you know, do you find a correlation to how
well you play in the tournament. We played one game, so I can't use one game.  
I would like to say that over, you know, 16 games we're pretty good. Over the
first 29, we won 27. So, therefore, we were pretty good.  
But it does prove to us that you can't show up in postseason play, because
instead of going to practice tomorrow and getting ready for the next opponent,
you got a week to wait and you're done. The BIG EAST for us, we're 14-3 in the
BIG EAST, season is over. You know, we may see another BIG EAST team just
because I do believe we're going to have at least nine people in the
tournament, which is great. But BIG EAST season is over. If that lets -- and
showing up as maybe -- because we beat a team, you know, pretty handily twice,
hopefully is a good lesson to our kids that seeds, during the midst of 40
minutes, or any rankings, mean nothing. Hopefully, that is a lesson that will
carry on to the tournament.  
Our two national championships have both come out of BIG EAST tournament
champions, but I don't know if it's automatic. You can go through the history
of the NCAA championships and you'll find that's not an automatic correlation,
no.  
But, obviously, we would have loved to have won today. It's incredibly
disappointing for our kids. The thing I liked about them - I don't mind using
this word - their championship side came out. I mean, we're going to make the
NCAA tournament, and we should be apt to what we've done during the regular
season, one of the highest seeds in the tournament. The kids weren't willing
to accept that. If you look at these faces, they weren't particularly willing
to accept the defeat either.  
So the fact -- there's no good losses, there's no moral victories, nothing of
that nature. But the champion in them did come out. The champion in them did
come out. You saw it very vividly. They weren't going away any place without
trying to win a game. And we came about as close as you possibly could come. I
give all the credit to Syracuse. Gerry's shot was absolutely magnificent.
Jimmy's strategy of spreading the floor against us, which he saw, so they used
Josh Wright and they used a different lineup than they normally would. Josh
Wright, I think - somebody could probably correct me - played two minutes
yesterday or three minutes yesterday and played virtually most of the game
today just the floor, much like Villanova has done this year and a few other
teams have tried to do against us.  
We give them all the credit. We're going back home. We're going to take a
couple days off, regroup, get ready for the NCAA tournament. Wish all our BIG
EAST brethren the best of luck in the NCAA tournament coming up.  
I know one thing. I love the BIG EAST and I'll root for everybody unless they
play against us, but I won't watch any TV. I won't be watching tomorrow night
or Saturday, no. It will hurt too much.  
Q. How do you use this loss to prepare for the NCAA tournament?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Well, I think I just said that. I think we showed up at the
game like a team that we had somehow or other glanced at our record and
glanced at the fact that we had played Syracuse twice and beaten them both
times. And, quite frankly, we led, I think - and I could be wrong about this -
25-5 up at the Dome, had a 19- or 20-point lead, 45-25 half time. Got it up to
30. They scored some points to get it to 8, or I think it ended up being 8,
but that was not indicative, and we beat them by 23 at our place.  
My point being is, but those things, just like the tournament - this
tournament and the NCAA tournament - no one really cares what seed that you
are, whether you beat someone before makes no difference. It's the 40 minutes
you're playing today that's the single most important thing.  
Q. Hilton, tell us, were they tougher inside today than they were before? It
looked like you guys had trouble.  
HILTON ARMSTRONG: I think they were a little tougher today than the other two
games.  
Q. Was it just more active?  
HILTON ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I guess.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I think the one thing, Phil, if you look at the stats, most
of those offensive rebounds are second-half rebounds. I think when we knew we
were in serious trouble - and we were in serious trouble through most of the
game - I think we responded, and that's the only thing I'll take home. Once
again, no moral wins, we're 28 and -- we're 27-3. Not 28 wins, which I just
gave the Freudian slip of. But, you know, this team is to be reckoned with in
the NCAA tournament. This team has a chance to get itself to Indianapolis and,
just like anybody else, has a chance to go home.  
I know the pain, I think you asked the question before of preparation, of
going home tonight. It's not going to be much fun. So I hope that carries over
in our preparation, getting ourselves ready for the NCAA tournament.  
Thanks, guys.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Eric Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16447)

### [James White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13730)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: James White, Eric Hicks, Coach Andy Kennedy._  
ANDY KENNEDY: Obviously, disappointed. Disappointed in the ending. Not
disappointed in our guys, but disappointed for them.  
We had our opportunities and we didn't take advantage of them. When you give a
team like Syracuse, who I have great respect for and the job Coach Boeheim
does year in and year out, and you let Gerry McNamara have a window of
opportunity, unfortunately sometimes you have to live with the feeling that we
currently have.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Coach, any thought to giving a foul there at the end to prevent that shot
from getting off?  
ANDY KENNEDY: Well, if memory serves, when we fouled, you know, obviously
we're only up two. So there was some concerns. We had fouls to give early, we
told them to foul, we fouled them a little too early on the first one and then
everybody gets hesitant. When we were hesitant, we were supposed to switch the
ball screen. We allowed him to split us. He hit a tough shot.  
Q. Can you talk about the interior post defense, especially by Darryl
Watkins on you early in the game and throughout the game.  
ERIC HICKS: He's a very big defender. He got the balls.  
Q. Is he tough to go around because he's so big?  
ERIC HICKS: He's just long. That's why he's a good factor in the two-three
zone, because of the size in the back that. And they get the balls very well.  
Q. Do you like your chances now (inaudible)?  
ANDY KENNEDY: I feel like if you look at - I hate to use the cliche
"collective body of work" \- but the one thing that I think separates us from
the "bubble" is strength of schedule. The one thing the committee has
consistently said, is if you control the part of your schedule you can, which
is obviously the nonleague part, and you play people on the road and you're
able to survive that, as we were, I think that's what's going to put us in a
good position. We're going to have a top 5 strength of schedule in the
country. I thought Saturday's win against West Virginia getting us to 8-8 in
the most powerful league in the country put us in a good position.  
Q. James, what was going on between you and (inaudible)?  
JAMES WHITE: Just the emotion of the game. He was talking a little bit, I was
talking. You know, it's an emotional game. He won the game, I didn't, so I
couldn't really say nothing too much afterwards (smiling).  
Q. James, you look back at this whole season. I mean, obviously, you're
disappointed right here, right now. But where you are going into Sunday, do
you look at that as a very positive thing that you guys have gotten to this
point?  
JAMES WHITE: I think it is positive that we have the chance to put ourselves
in a position to make the NCAA tournament. A lot of people said we couldn't. I
mean, we're looking for more. We're hoping to go to the NCAA tournament and
make some noise.  
Hopefully we get in, and then once we get there, we hope to do some things.  
Q. Coach, did this game in some ways clear the resilience of your team, with
everything that happened back in the summertime, the turmoil?  
ANDY KENNEDY: Sure, there's some turmoil. You must not be from Ohio. There's a
lot of turmoil. Really, this team has been tremendously resilient. You know,
I'm very, very proud of the fact that our guys, despite all the obstacles that
continued to mount against them, never used that as an excuse not to be
successful. I'm hopeful we're rewarded on Sunday for that attitude and that
approach.  
Today, I don't really fault our effort and our approach. It was our inability
to make free throws, it was our inability to make shots against that two-three
zone. Obviously, you know you're going to have to face it, but we just did not
take advantage of our opportunities right till the bitter end. As a result,
unfortunately, you put yourself in a position to feel the way that we do
today.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about James' game today.  
ANDY KENNEDY: He had a monster game. Kept us in despite some other guys maybe
not playing as well as they're capable. Made big shot after big shot for us.
It's really a tribute to James' maturity as a player.  
Q. How different does this postseason feel (inaudible)?  
ANDY KENNEDY: It feels a lot different. The shield is gone for me personally.
The view is a little different standing up.  
Q. Coach, just elaborate on your resume for a minute. Do you believe the LSU
win in Vegas is probably going to be the biggest thing that gets you over the
top? It's that signature nonconference win.  
ANDY KENNEDY: You asked, so now I'm going to tell you.  
We've got 12 wins versus the RPI top 100. If you're a fan of the RPI or not,
we have a top 5 in the country strength of schedule. We're playing in the best
league in the country, having won eight games at Syracuse, at Marquette, West
Virginia at home. We beat the SEC champion on a neutral site. We won at
Vanderbilt. They won 28 straight versus nine SEC opponents. We beat Miami of
Ohio. We beat Murray State. We beat Ohio U.  
To me, I don't understand why we're having this conversation. I think the only
reason that we are - and justifiably so - is the fact that we are viewed as
two different teams with our mean and post our mean. That's justifiable.
That's why us finishing strong down the stretch, I think, was imperative in
order for us to put ourselves in a position.  
But I am hopeful for these guys that we will live to fight again in the Big
Dance. If, indeed, that is the case, I'm hopeful that we can end on a good
note.  
_THE MODERATOR: Cincinnati, thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Quincy Douby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13741)

### [Gary Waters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13739)

### [Marquis Webb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13740)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Coach Gary Waters, Marquis Webb and Quincy Douby._  
COACH GARY WATERS: Okay, everyone's here. As I always do, I give honor to God
first before I speak any place.  
I thought our kids followed the game plan extremely well. It may have -- it
was not an offensive game because if you look at both percentages we didn't
shoot very well. I thought we executed better in the second half offensively,
though.  
But what I did realize is that our game plan, to take Whitney away, gave us an
opportunity with this team. Without taking him away, you don't have an
opportunity. Our guys worked extremely hard. I thought we rebounded the ball
well. I thought we did the things we had to do to be successful, and this team
is dedicated toward that. They followed it. What we told them to do, they did
everything to a T.  
There's nothing I can say but was a great, great concentrated performance by
our team.  
Q. What was the key to stopping Whitney?  
COACH GARY WATERS: Well, we doubled him. Normally, in the past, we are
doubling from post to post. That's hurt us. Quincy -- I mean Whitney is a very
good passer out of the post. When you double with another post guy, he finds
that guy. We kept our post guy holding this time so he could rebound and help
on the back side and we doubled him with a guard. And we knew, once you
started doubling, didn't matter who we're doubling, he would be fearful of the
double. And it worked.  
Q. Coach, is this a bit of deja vu? Same thing last year.  
COACH GARY WATERS: I don't know if it's, you know, deja vu because we didn't
expect to come in here and win one, we expected to come in here and take
another step forward. We aim to play and came to continue playing, not just
feel that we've won one game. Literally, I'm going to tell you, I told our
team in the locker room before we went out on the floor, I told them when we
win this game I don't want them jumping up and down and celebrating because we
got another. Go out and be class so we can go out for the next one.  
Q. It looked like people were expecting Douby to have 30-something points.
How big of a factor was that if your other players stepped up?  
COACH GARY WATERS: The thing you've seen from Douby is he can do more than
just shoot the basketball. The thing he did, when they doubled him, he found
the open guys. I thought that was the key to the game. Even in the second
half, we ran things through him and he found other people. And, you know, when
I look at these stats, he still scored 18 points and that's all we needed in a
game this low.  
Q. Marquis, you all have played under a lot of distractions in the last
couple weeks. Was it very important tonight to play for Coach Waters, to send
him out on a good note?  
MARQUIS WEBB: It was definitely important. Coming into the season, one of our
goals was to make it to the BIG EAST tournament. We made it here, and we
wasn't just satisfied with just being here. You know, we were trying to take
another step forward.  
Q. Coach, you had mentioned defensively it was to stop Whitney. You've been
able to maintain control over Nutter and Laing.  
COACH GARY WATERS: Well, we really didn't control Laing, I mean -- Copeland.
Copeland, we knew that we had to just contain him as much as we could. We
really weren't overconcerned because he hit shots. The two people we wanted to
shut down was No. 1, Whitney, No. 2, Nutter. Nutter had the best defensive
player in the league, even though he didn't get the award I thought he should
have, in Marquis Webb.  
Q. I believe it's about the team, stay focused. The sense a lot of us are
getting is you guys were playing for Coach.  
QUINCY DOUBY: That's not really it, you know. We playing like as hard as we
was playing all season for Coach. We focus. We have a lot of focus. We know
what we have to do. We want to make a run in this tournament because, you
know, it's wide open right now. It's not going to be easy. Whoever's the most
prepared, come out there ready to fight, you know, got the opportunity to win
it. So that's what we did today. We're not playing harder because he's leaving
and stuff. We're just playing hard because that's what we got to do for Coach,
what he asks of us.  
Q. The past is the past. The last month, it is what it is. We all know what
it is. Does it make you sad at all to see this type of performance, especially
the second half from the guys that you brought here, knowing you're not going
to be able to coach them?  
COACH GARY WATERS: It's sad that I'm not going to be with them anymore because
they're very close to me. I'm going to tell you this, they've been playing
this hard throughout the entire season. That's what Quincy is saying. They've
been playing this hard all the way through the season. They lost close games,
last second games, these kind of things. Also, we lost two very good players.
This team has played this well. Now, they're more concentrated on their
effort. Each person is playing.  
We put on the board before we played the game, we put the word "T". Then we
explained what T means, okay. They all talked about it. They knew that they
had to share this in order to be successful tonight.  
Q. From the outside it would seem like there's a lot of chaos going on at
the Rutgers program. You were losing, now you're winning. Does it feel chaotic
to you guys?  
QUINCY DOUBY: I don't feel chaotic. We guys love playing basketball. We know
we have a lot more basketball to play. We just want to get here and didn't
want to lay down and lose. We said we were going to advance and, you know, try
to see if we could make a postseason tournament after this was over. We want
to keep on playing ball. It has nothing to do with the behind the scenes
stuff. We just love ball and we want to play.  
Q. With the overtime the last game, does that give you confidence?  
COACH GARY WATERS: Well, that was a different team, okay. We had two starters
that are no longer here because they're injured. That was a different team.  
But we're a different team today than we were back then. I think we can go out
and play this team extremely hard. What happened, this is the number, what,
two team in America. We have to play our very best to have an opportunity in
this game. I tell you this, they're not going to go out there to lay down and
die, though.  
Q. Quincy, how much of a difference did it make tonight to get the help from
Anthony, the big threes from Marquis, to have Byron do such a job on Kelly?  
QUINCY DOUBY: I just watched film from the last game when we played at Seton
Hall. I thought to myself I did a terrible job at finding my teammates. JR had
got hurt early in the game, so, you know, I did a bad job of finding guys.
This game I knew they were going to come double team me. I tried to get guys
open look, they knock down shots, took advantage of it. It just made the game
a lot more easier.  
Q. Quincy and Marquis, Villanova, two months after you played them last
time, different circumstances but a lot more riding on this one.  
QUINCY DOUBY: It's gonna be a tough game. But, you know, Coach is doing a good
job, as usual. We just have to prepare for them. Go over film probably tonight
and get ready for them tomorrow.  
MARQUIS WEBB: Definitely, always playing Villanova, the No. 2 team in the
country, is always going to be tough. In tournament play, anything is
possible. Anybody can get upset at any time. That's what we're looking forward
to do.  
Q. Marquis, getting a victory against Seton Hall in an environment such as
this, how is that?  
MARQUIS WEBB: Like I said before, playing here at Madison Square Garden,
anything is possible. Playing here, you know, anything, like I just said,
anything is possible. Tomorrow, you know, we're just going to come out and
play hard.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Aaron Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13745)

### [Carl Krauser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13743)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Aaron Gray, Carl Krauser and Coach Dixon._  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I thought it was a great -- two great teams. We knew as a
team that they were going to come back strong the second half. I thought our
guys responded well. Executed well. Did what we had to do.  
I thought obviously first half we played very well, defended very well, which
got our offense going, and got a lot of good performances from a number of
guys. But I think we battled back. We knew it was gonna get physical second
half, we knew what type of game was gonna happen. I thought our guys responded
well to it.  
Time to get ready for West Virginia. We won't focus on this one too much. We
have to get ready for them. I thought Carl was great handling the ball,
handling the pressure of the trap, as well as Levance and Ronald, and we did a
great job on the boards which was something we emphasized going into it.  
Q. Can you talk about why you decided to make a change in the starting
lineup?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Keith has just been playing well. Just been doing a great
job in practice and a great job getting back. He's just getting better. I
mean, we've said about improving and getting better. Keith is getting better.
All of our guys are getting better. We saw something with Keith, and he's
constantly improving and working hard and doing a good job - as are all our
guys.  
Q. Drawing on your experiences from West Virginia previously, what do you
have to do similar and what do you have to do differently?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Well, we gotta defend and guard the perimeter, as everybody
knows. No secrets there.  
Rebounding, we've got to beat them on the boards and do a great job just
getting out on their shooters and doing it for 40 minutes. You can't have any
breakdowns because they're so dangerous, as we know.  
But I think our guys will be ready. I know they're going to get some rest
tonight, and we'll be ready to go. You can ask these guys.  
Q. Can you talk about establishing yourselves inside.  
AARON GRAY: The guys, they did a great job of giving me the ball. I made a few
good decisions, bad decisions. The guards were doing a great job knocking out
shots. It forced them not to be able to double down or triple down. And then,
you know, when I got the ball, I felt I was making a good decision on the
post. That was one of the things that we wanted to emphasize. We knew with
Padgett out there he could go down and utilize our post game. We did that.
Obviously, we got out to, you know, a big lead because of it.  
Q. Jamie, you were critical of your defense the last two games. Was your
defense that much sharper this time around?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I don't remember ever really being critical about our
defense. We're constantly trying to improve. That's what we talk about,
getting better and improving. That's not critical, that's just coaching and
getting better and trying to improve as we go.  
So I thought it was very good. Defense, we were very good in the first half. I
think we did a great job guarding their come off screens, we did a good job of
extending the defense all the way through. It was pretty consistent. We had a
few things that we wanted to do better, but very consistent in the first half.
Carried over to the second half. They made tough shots. A different game as we
could tell and everybody could see, it became a little bit more physical. Our
guys responded well. I thought we played very good defense all the way
through.  
Q. Carl, can you talk about keeping focus when the score is 33 to 5.  
CARL KRAUSER: You know, when you're up by that much, you have to understand
that you have to keep playing. There's still a lot of time left and you don't
want to go out there and just think the game is over. Because every team in
this BIG EAST Conference is competitive. We wanted to go out there, take care
of the ball, move the ball, have everybody in right positions to score and
just make plays. We were just trying to stay solid, like Coach said, and that
got us a win.  
Q. Jamie, did the offense get a little bit too conservative for your taste
in the second half?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: No, I thought we were very good. I thought we got the ball
inside. You're not going to go 40 minutes of constantly making shots. It
wasn't anything about that.  
They made some shots in the second half that we expected them to make, maybe
that they didn't make in the first half. That's just basketball, being around
it, knowing good teams, good players, good programs that they're going to
respond. No team is gonna go through a situation for 40 minutes.  
So that was to be expected. I thought we did a good job defensively, on the
defensive end all the way through. Offensively, I thought we made good
decisions, got good shots. Sometimes they don't fall as you want, but I
thought we were pretty good all the way through.  
Q. Carl, you said it's important to keep your focus when you have a big lead
like that. Was the team able to do that? It didn't seem like you did, the way
they came back.  
CARL KRAUSER: You know, those guys, they're coached by a great coach and
they're a great team. Great teams make plays. They were out there making
plays.  
But at the same time, you know, we had to stay solid and we had to stick
together and we had to come out here and get a win, and that's what we did
exactly. We stayed solid, we stayed together, we kept our poise and we made
plays and we got a win.  
Q. Is there too much made out of the fatigue thing with West Virginia
getting a bye and you guys having to play tonight? Does that really matter?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: You know, we talked about, you know, most minutes anybody
played was 31 for us today, so that was good, and I think that's a good sign.  
We would have been practicing anyway. These guys love to play. They've been
playing anyway. So we practiced the other day and the guys wanted to keep
going once I wanted to stop. So that's just what they do. They like to play.
Most teams are like that. Most kids are like that. Our players are definitely
like that.  
Q. Aaron, Coach was asked about this earlier. Your thoughts on West
Virginia? If there's one thing you guys can do better as a team as opposed
last time you played them, what would it be?  
AARON GRAY: Guard Pittsnogle. I mean, he got a lot of good looks early. You
know, just started feeling it. He did a great job of getting his teammates
involved. You know, they just got hot. And, you know, like Coach Dixon said,
we need to worry about perimeter defense. I mean, they shoot so many threes
that, you know, they play the percentages, they figure they got to make some
of them. We got to do a good job of doing that.  
Then we really need to utilize our rebounding. I mean, I think we should have
done a better job of that in Morgantown, especially on the offensive end,
because our team feeds so much on not only getting one shot on each
possession, but two or three shots. If we can do that, we'll be fine.  
Q. Can you talk about Ron's night. Quiet, but the team needs him out there,
it seems.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: He's solid. The guys know where he's going to be. You can
count on him. He's a good defender. Again, there's two sides of the ball and
two things you got to do - defend and offensive. He did a good job on the
defensive end. Great contributor. Had a great job all the way around, I
thought. Did a good job.  
You know, he was handling the press. He was throwing it ahead. He had no
turnovers against a team that pressed for 40 minutes, especially in the second
half where it was, you know, they're getting after it, looking to create
turnovers, get steals, reach in, and doing that sort of thing. So, again, zero
turnovers, 30 minutes of making good decisions.  
Q. Coach, the last 13 and a half minutes, did you do anything different?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I think we went to the free throw line a lot of those
times. I mean, that has something to do with the field goals. I think they
were aggressive. We may have made some turnovers. It just becomes a different
game when you're down and they're playing a little bit different to how they
play as far as trapping everything.  
You know, games become a different game when you're up by 20. It's not played
the same way. It's not called the same way. It's just what happens.

### [Taquan Dean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13749)

### [Andre McGee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13750)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Coach Rick Pitino._  
COACH RICK PITINO: Go ahead if you have any questions.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Talk about the comeback.  
COACH RICK PITINO: It's your question. You want me to play reporter, you come
up here.  
Q. What went into the first half?  
COACH RICK PITINO: We just got destroyed on the backboard, and then panicked a
little bit and took bad shots and got weighed down because of it.  
But the rebounding was so dominant on one side that it just -- we were just
taken to the wood shed on the glass.  
Q. Did Pitt force you guys into a lot of bad shots?  
COACH RICK PITINO: You know, it's one of those nights where just in the first
five or six minutes everything goes wrong. If you're a veteran team, you can
play through it. If you're a good defensive team as far as size, you can get
through it, withstand that type of thing. We're not an overly physical
basketball team. We just couldn't get through that stretch.  
You have to give them credit.  
Q. Coach, what was the difference in the second half, the last 13 minutes,
when you guys made your run?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I think just we were highly embarrassed about our play. We
had one rebound from a whole starting unit. I think the guys were embarrassed.
They had pride and just tried to do the best we can to come back and win. If
we took care of the basketball a little bit better, we actually could have won
the game.  
Q. Taquan, what happens when you look at the scoreboard and it's 38-5, do
you ignore that? What's your feeling on that?  
TAQUAN DEAN: You're not gonna get it back on one play, so you got to keep
chipping at it. We've been down before, so, you know, wasn't rattled by it. At
the same time, we knew we had to play good defense and get good shots.  
Q. Rick, at any point when you got down, did it flash through your mind
(inaudible)?  
COACH RICK PITINO: Well, I actually told them with 15:35 to go in the game,
This is exactly the situation I was in a few years ago, and that we can do it,
we can come back. We just got to take smart shots, treat every possession as
if the game is on the line, and we can win it. I actually did mention that
game.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Donald Copeland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13737)

### [Louis Orr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13736)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Coach Louis Orr and Donald Copeland._  
COACH LOUIS ORR: To God be the glory. I want to praise Him for just blessing
us and keeping us and being such a good God to us. I thank Him for his grace
and his mercy.  
Hey, you know, it's awful hard to beat a team when it's tough to put the ball
in the basket. I thought our defensive effort and our game plan against
Rutgers, especially Quincy Douby, I thought we did a very good job getting the
ball out of his hand. I thought we gave ourselves a chance. But, you know,
it's tough when you shoot 25% for the game. You know, really, just it seemed
like it was a lid on the basket. We got open looks, the ball wouldn't drop.  
Donald was a soldier out there for us. He didn't quit. If it wasn't for him,
we would have struggled even more. It was just a game where we didn't make
shots. When you don't make shots, regardless of what the defense is like, it's
going to be tough to win.  
Q. Donald, can you tell me what you envision the next four days will be like
up until the selection announcement? Are you concerned that what happened
tonight will have a big impact on it?  
DONALD COPELAND: No, we feel that we built a strong enough resume, you know,
finishing top seven in our league. We got some key wins down the stretch and
throughout the year.  
So, you know, you can't let tonight take that away. We feel confident of what
we've accomplished through the regular season.  
Q. Is this particularly frustrating considering what you did at
Pittsburgh?  
COACH LOUIS ORR: You know, you got to look at the whole body of work. Each
game stands on its own merits. Going to Pittsburgh and, you know, giving them
their only loss of the year and coming off beating a Cincinnati team, a tough
Cincinnati team, you know, we put two quality wins back-to-back at the end of
the year. We're disappointed with the game tonight, but it doesn't, to me,
deter the body of work that we put together. This is the toughest conference
in America. Being 9-7, you know, finishing seventh, and also the road wins we
got, our resume is definitely strong enough to get us into the NCAA
tournament.  
Q. It looked like your game plan was to shut Douby down. You doubled him
every chance you got, but you let the rest of the Rutgers team beat you. Was
that the game plan?  
COACH LOUIS ORR: Not quite like that. We didn't want Douby to have a big game,
but we also didn't want anyone else to have a big game. In reality, Farmer hit
14 and Webb 10. Defensively, considering we shot 25% from the floor, I thought
we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish. But the tough thing was just for
us to be able to generate offense.  
Donald was -- I mean, he scored more than half our points. It's hard for us,
for any team to win, unless you get your top two or three scorers, if you can
get them going and have big games. But we just didn't make enough shots.  
Q. Seemed offensively you didn't flow. Can you figure out why that was?  
COACH LOUIS ORR: Well, you know what, I think I give Rutgers some credit. They
tried to make Kelly uncomfortable, doubling him. We've been sharing the
basketball all year and Kelly has been getting doubled all year, so that
wasn't anything new.  
I just think, you know, you need to see the ball go in the basket in order to
get a rhythm going. We had some wide open looks. Our perimeter guys, I mean,
we were 7 for 27 from three. We're going to watch the tape. We got a lot of
good looks. Again, nobody's trying to miss shots, but, you know, the ball just
didn't drop.  
Q. In terms of the other games, will you watch other tournaments and see how
things work out? Will you micromanage this?  
DONALD COPELAND: No, I mean, it's really out of my hands. It's not my job to
watch anybody else. It's just about us getting back in the practice and
working on what we need to work on. We're going to prepare for the NCAA
tournament. Like I said before, I feel our resume is pretty strong. So
regardless what happens in any other tournaments, I still feel pretty good
about our chances making it.  
Q. Coach, when you watch on Sunday, is it going to be an anxious time, or
you're hoping to get in, or is it going to be you know you're in, it's just a
matter of where you go?  
COACH LOUIS ORR: I feel confident in what we've done. I'm going there with the
anticipation to hear our name being called on Sunday. I'm a guy that does a
lot of praying anyway, so I will continue to pray. I know God is a good God.
He's got good things in store for this team. I'm going to keep the faith.  
Based on what we've accomplished this year, without a doubt, you know, I'm
confident in our resume to get in, you know. We just have to wait and see what
happens on Sunday.  
_THE MODERATOR: Seton Hall, thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Colin Falls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13735)

### [Chris Quinn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13734)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: For Notre Dame we're going to have Colin Falls and Chris Quinn
with Coach Mike Brey._  
COACH MIKE BREY: They're a very good, very poised basketball team. I thought
we gave up second shots at key times. That really hurt us.  
Gave ourselves a chance to win, but put-backs by them hurt us. We finished the
first half so well and we started the second half just poorly, and then you're
digging out of a hole.  
But I give Georgetown credit. They're older and they played together for a
while. They don't get rattled. They just methodically played.  
Q. Can you talk about defensively in the second half, (inaudible).  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, you know, I love the fact that it was 41% field goal
percentage defense. I mean, overall, they got into a better rhythm against the
zone in the second half. But the key possessions, I thought, we forced the
right shot. They also hit two bombs at the end of shot clocks. We were in man
one possession, we were in zone one. I think I can live with those. I mean,
they hit big ones.  
Even though their rhythm may have been better against our zone, I thought the
first shot was missing for the most part. It was the second shot that hurt us.
I thought we defended -- the shot that Bowman made was a tough shot. I mean,
Torin rode him kind of into the cheerleaders and he hit a lefty runner. I
mean, that's just a talented play. We can't do much better there.  
Q. Coach, do you feel (inaudible) when you play teams?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Not really. I think for us we tried to flush all that when we
went through that stretch in the first half of the BIG EAST.  
I mean, I think for us, I've never wanted that to be an excuse or whatever. I
will say this: People have hit some big shots on us, and tough shots. Those
two threes were bombs. Maybe the karma is a little different, I don't know.  
But I think it's kind of petty if you fall into that trap, and they haven't.
They've been resilient and not used that as an excuse.  
Q. Colin, just talk about how tough it was.  
COLIN FALLS: Yeah, I mean, I got out in transition the first probably three or
four plays of the game. Chris found me, and I made some shots. But they put
the clamps down on D, they were showing on all screens. It made it difficult
to get open looks.  
Q. When you got up 11-0, was it a matter of them settling into their game?
Did you notice a specific change?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I think they're a good team. They're going to make a run at
us. I was happy the start we got off to. I never thought, you know, we were
going to hold -- I thought it was going to be game situations and get down to
it because they're too experienced a group. Second shots helped them get into
the rhythm in both halves.  
Q. Chris, could you talk about the disappointment. You guys came in here, I
thought, with a lot of confidence. Talk about not getting it done.  
CHRIS QUINN: Yeah, you know, we talked a lot about our last two games kind of
being part of the BIG EAST tournament at Providence and versus DePaul. In
order for us to be here, we had to win those games. We came off those two
games very confident, coming in here.  
You know, Georgetown played great. I think they really, you know, stayed with
their game plan and how they want to play, you know, even when we got off to a
great start.  
Q. You talked a lot about playing loosely. Did you feel like you guys did
that? It seemed like you were tight in spots.  
CHRIS QUINN: Maybe in spots. I think offensively we played pretty loosely, I
think. Forced them to take some tough shots on the defensive end. I think we
just needed to do a better job of being quicker to the ball and getting the
loose balls and rebounds.  
Q. Mike, real quickly, can you talk about Rob Kurz.  
COACH MIKE BREY: I thought Rob has grown into a BIG EAST forward, you know,
over the last month. Certainly that's something we really want to build on.
He's been coming. Really feel good about him. Got to get him as much
experience in this postseason as possible because he's coming back as a
junior.  
I think he really can walk out of here certainly disappointed about losing,
but I'm going to grab him in the hotel. He has arrived as a BIG EAST forward.  
Q. Mike, what did you say to the guys?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I mean, I told them, I said, you know, great effort.
Again, but second shots cost us. That's, you know, hurt us at times. Speed to
the ball. We wouldn't win the 40-yard dash lining up with those guys. We tried
to pack it in a little bit where we wouldn't have to chase it down as much.
For the most part, we did a pretty good job. But at key times, that really
hurt us.  
I said, Before we play again next week - because we will play again next week
- we're going to work on that and we're going to get back and practice, and I
want us to take advantage of getting to still play basketball, you know,
certainly for some old guys but our young guys, too.  
_THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame, thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Brandon Bowman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13732)

### [Roy Hibbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13731)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: In March, any win is a good win. That's a very good
win against a very tough team that did what they've done all year - they
fight. They keep fighting, they keep coming. We got down early. Then we
responded and came back.  
I just thought it was a tough game. Two teams that play tough. I thought our
team played very well in the second half today.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Can you talk about the way Brandon played. You've been on him all year.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Two years (smiling). That is accurate. I thought
Brandon Bowman, he had a special performance today. Not just the points, I
just told him in the locker room, he made smart plays. He got it in there,
threw the right passes, got big rebounds when we needed it. A lot of little
things that make you win games, not just the points. Brandon did all the
little things today - coming up with balls, getting a deflection here, talking
on defense. Then, on top of that, he put the ball in the basket. I thought he
was terrific today, there's no other way to put it.  
Q. Can you talk about your team's work on the offensive boards. Half of the
shots you missed you got offensive rebounds.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Means we're missing too much (smiling).  
We have to do that. We had to do that. We wanted to get -- we started off the
game, you know, and that zone had it spread out a little too much. We took, I
don't know the exact numbers, but I feel like we took too many threes early.
Jeff got a couple inside and missed but other than that we took too many
threes early. Then we went to one of our sets. We wanted to try to get it on
the inside. We were in position to do that. Our guys made a conscious effort
to go after the ball. These guys just went after the ball.  
Q. Can you talk about Roy's presence, especially defensively on the
boards.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Roy's presence?  
Q. Especially defensively.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Yeah, honestly, I thought that - and I didn't realize
- I felt that he had scored more points, looking at the stat sheet now. I
thought he was a presence on offense also just because he draws so much
attention. People gravitating to Roy enable that middle to be open so much.  
On the defensive end, he's getting better. He's getting better. But, you know,
he is a presence, and we need him to continue to be a bigger presence.  
Q. Brandon, talk about your game today, the importance of your
contribution.  
BRANDON BOWMAN: It was kind of like what Coach said, being a senior, you got
to step up, make big plays. Doesn't just include scoring and what not. It's
everything else.  
You know, I got a couple big offensive rebounds during the stretch, you know,
that we kind of converted on. So, I mean, plays like that, a couple tips here
and there on defense, you know, things like that, getting loose balls, those
are all things Coach has been preaching to the team about. I mean, we've been
doing our best to try to, you know, do that. We know that in March it takes
all those plays to win games. I'm just trying to contribute basically.  
Q. Brandon, can you talk about that last basket. You went up for the
drive.  
BRANDON BOWMAN: Oh, man, that's eight minutes, that's eight-minute layups
before every practice. Practice that layup going to the left side, hop the
glass, you know. It worked.  
The coaches, they preach make layups. We were missing a lot of layups. I mean,
Coach has been uneasy about it, but I think today we did a good job for the
most part. That's all it is, putting it up high off the glass. Went in.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: That was a nice layup, wasn't it? That was a really
nice layup. Work on it every day.  
Q. Any specific adjustments you make for tomorrow against Marquette,
Coach?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I can answer that in a couple hours. You know, I
don't know. I got to figure that out in a couple hours. You play one good
team, then you got to get ready for another good team. You play one team that
has guys that can put the ball in the basket then you play against another
team that has guys that can put the ball in the basket.  
We'll see. We'll see.  
_THE MODERATOR: Georgetown, thank you._

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2006

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Gerry McNamara](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13726)

### [Terrence Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13727)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Two games we played with Cincinnati; we dominated them in
the second half, they dominated us. Today was an opportunity to see who could
get it done.  
I thought for about 34 minutes we played as well as we played, and, you know,
we just didn't do a good job defensively against White. He made some great
shots.  
But, you know, we made a couple bad mistakes at the end of the game, and
fortunately Gerry corrected them. That's about the way it went.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Gerry, as far as big shots go, how would you rank that shot?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, I think this, with the situation we're in, under the
circumstances, this is probably the most important to me right now. Under the
circumstances, this is the most important shot that I've hit. In the situation
we're in, we're fighting and trying to battle for every game, we needed this
one. There was no doubt about it.  
You know, I'm just happy it went in. We're going to have a tough game
tomorrow. Connecticut is a great team. You have to tip your hat to Cincinnati
because we controlled the game for a lot of that. And the four- or five-minute
stretch, they put us, you know, against the wall. They really did.  
You know, I just hit a shot. You know, that could have gone either way. Then
Muhhamad almost makes the next one. That's how the game went. Pretty evenly-
matched teams.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: It was close.  
Q. Their comeback, was it something they did better?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, White got open. They moved the ball better. The
biggest problem is we stopped scoring. We missed some plays, we missed a
couple layups. You know, we're not going to shut them out. We just stopped
scoring for two, three minutes.  
Our defense, I thought, was better. Our defense has struggled all year, but it
was much better today. But having breakdowns and making mistakes, it's cost us
all year. For a while tonight, our defense was really good. I really thought
even though we had a couple breakdowns on defense, we stopped scoring for two,
three, four minutes there, and, you know, that hurt us.  
But I thought the good thing about us offensively is we got everybody involved
today. When they doubled, we were able to get the ball to Terrence. Terrence
made plays, which we haven't done. Mooky (phonetic spelling) finished inside.
It was really the best balance that we've had all year long. That was probably
the difference, the balance.  
Q. Coach, it seemed like you were telling them to be patient. Was that a
problem?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Were they? Yeah, they found James White and, you know, made
a foul-line play. He was the guy. He had a tremendous game. We couldn't do
anything with him the whole game really.  
Q. Gerry, on that last point when you get the in-bounds pass, what are you
thinking? Are you thinking you're going to take the shot? Are you thinking
it's going to be a three?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: I wanted to take what I got. Muhhamad did a pretty good job of
shielding me and forcing me in the lane. Terrence ran up for the screen. When
I went back against the grain, they hedged. All I had was to split it. You
know, if I'm gonna take a runner, I'm not gonna step on the line. I made sure
I was behind the line.  
Plus, there wasn't much time. You know, I knew the clock situation, and, you
know, I wouldn't have gotten a layup. So I took the three. I knew I was taking
a three at that point, so, you know. If I had a layup opportunity, I would
have taken it.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: We knew they had another foul to give, that's why I didn't
take the time-out. I was hoping that Gerry could get it and go before they
could stop and say, "Hey." They still had one more foul to give and then there
would have been no time left. I thought we were better having Gerry try to go
and make a play.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Darryl Watkins. He had a career high today.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I think Mooky is just starting. He's a junior. I think all
of our Juniors are in a position where they're just -- this year is the first
year they've had responsibility to carry us. I think it's just taking them --
they haven't had that responsibility. They didn't have it as sophomores, they
didn't have it as freshmen even to be factors. I think that it's been a hard
year for them to understand they've got to be the guys. Today is really the
first day that I thought all of the three front line guys were involved in the
game, all three. We've had one, two maybe; we haven't had all three.  
You know, Gerry has been very consistent for us all year, his whole career. I
have to laugh a little bit when our own paper is calling him, our own student
newspaper is calling him "overrated." They actually listened to a couple
assistant coaches who I guarantee you will never be head coaches if they think
Gerry McNamara is overrated. Of course our paper won't print that anyway
because that's -- you know, somebody said it.  
Without Gerry McNamara, we wouldn't have won 10 fuckin' games this year. Okay,
not ten. The other guys just aren't ready. They needed him. Without him there,
not ten. We wouldn't be here to even have a chance to play this game. And
everybody's talking to me and writing about Gerry McNamara being overrated?
That's the most bullshit thing I've seen in 30 years - and especially if it
comes from our people in our papers.  
But they're quoted from somebody else, an anonymous assistant coach. Let the
assistant coach come up to me and say, "Gerry McNamara is overrated." I'd like
to see one of those guys come up to me and say that. He's been double-teamed
every game this year, and the coaches voted him First Team All-Conference. The
head coaches, they don't know shit, I guess.  
Q. That's a hard one to follow up on.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Is there a fine for that (laughter)?  
_THE MODERATOR: I don't think so._  
Q. How many times did you play this game when you were a kid, Gerry,
dreaming of this being the last shot, probably the last shot of your Syracuse
career?  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well...  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Come on!  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Every kid does. Every kid dreams of making a shot. I'm not
worried about it. This game's over with. I'm glad I made it. More importantly,
we won the game. That's really all that matters here. We move on and we need
to. I think that's the most important thing to realize. We need to win. You
know, we're fighting, and hopefully we can get another one. If we're going to
do it, we have to do it against probably the best team in the country.  
Q. Gerry, do you remember the shot that you took prior to that last shot?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: The little air ball.  
GERRY MCNAMARA: Well, that little air ball I guess doesn't really mean
anything now, does it?  
Q. Terrence, can you talk about Mooky today and his performance. He had a
career high 15. Is this one of his better games?  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: I definitely think it was one of his better games. I think
all our guys did a great job of driving, penetrating to the basket and getting
open looks. He did a great job of finishing. We were working on that all this
week and before the game, stuff like that.  
I just told the guys before the game, We just got to be able to get out there
and finish, be strong. I think we all did a good job of that throughout the
night.  
Q. Can you talk about what Gerry has meant to the team this season.  
TERRENCE ROBERTS: Like Coach said, without him, we probably wouldn't have won
10 games. He's been our backbone this year. He's carried us. He's helped me
and all the other juniors come out here and slowly mature. Without him, we
wouldn't even be here.  
Q. Coach, if I told you coming in you'd turn the ball over 22 times, do you
think you'd win?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: You know, they're a gambling pressure team. Eric just got a
little careless a couple times. When we attacked their trap, we got layups.
So, you know, when your team gambles, you got to make them pay. One of the
reasons that Mooky and Terrence got those layups is because they were
extending their defense. We just didn't handle it as well as I think we could
have. But you're going to turn over a little bit against a team that extends
like that.  
We're still, you know, making some mistakes, some unforced mistakes that cost
you. They would have cost us tonight. We can't take the ball in bounds when
they go ahead. I mean, that kind of a mistake, you know, you shouldn't
probably be able to win, if you make a mistake like that. You can't inbound
the ball. Gerry is standing there wide open, and Eric, who we don't tend to
take the ball inbounds to anyway, is covered, and we try to throw the ball to
him. That's just an unforced error that you just can't make, those kind of
mistakes.  
But Cincinnati is a veteran team. They have three really good seniors that
have won a lot of games, they've been in a lot of situations. You know, they
made 17 turnovers, 17. I mean, first game in a tournament, sometimes you make
some mistakes. That happens. You have to play through them, basically.  
Q. Jim, what kind of balance did you show tonight? How much better prepared
are you for Connecticut?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Connecticut is a great team. I've said it from the
beginning of the year. Jim keeps telling me not to say it. They're a great
team. There's no way to hide it, you know. We were not in either game when we
played them. You know, we just have to get ready and be ready to play.  
I mean, anything can happen in college basketball. It happens all the time.
West Virginia women's team lost eight straight games and beat Rutgers by 20
points. Anything can happen. That's just the way it is in tournament play. You
know, we just have to be ready and go out and play.  
Q. Jim, you said patience on offense was the key.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: It's more than that. That's just one part of it. You know,
you have to be patient. You have to make good plays. You have to battle. The
first game we battled them on the boards remarkably. But the second game, they
just dominated us on the boards.  
But, you know, we were not in either game, and, you know, we just have to turn
that completely around. Sometimes you play a team and you're battling them.
You're in there. You have to look back and say, "Well, we could have done this
or that." But we played Cincinnati two, three weeks ago and they beat us by 20
points. So you don't know in college basketball. It's a funny game.  
_THE MODERATOR: Syracuse, thank you._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2006

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Brandon Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16306)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Mountain West Conference champions, San
Diego State. We have with us head coach Steve Fisher and student-athletes
Marcus Slaughter, Brandon Heath and Kyle Spain._  
_Coach, if you'll open with some comments._  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I was wrong, I said there wouldn't be two of you left, but
we got six (smiling).  
The thing that impressed me the most was the way we shot the ball in overtime.
Three for five, seven for eight. We went into overtime, they not only fought
and defended and guarded, but you saw the Aztecs play the way we've played a
lot this year.  
We struggled to make baskets in three games, so I'm doubly proud of the fact
we're the last dog standing. That's a tribute to these three and the rest of
our group.  
We will proudly represent the Mountain West Conference in the NCAA tournament.
We feel good about ourselves.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes._  
Q. Brandon, can you talk about your play in overtime, just what enabled you
to step up?  
BRANDON HEATH: I mean, we went down by six about two minutes left. Came to the
huddle, everybody just tried to stay positive. It came down to getting stops
and rebounding. Guys made plays on the offensive end.  
That's all it came down to, make good plays.  
Q. Brandon, probably a horrendous game for you by your standards overall. 7
for 27 from the field. What turned it around for you in overtime?  
BRANDON HEATH: I don't know, man, just our team. Our back was against the
wall. My name was called, I just tried to answer. My teammates believed in me.
They got me the ball in the right situations. I just tried to capitalize.
Thank you, guys.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions now for Coach Fisher._  
Q. Can you talk about going into overtime knowing you're playing without
Marcus Slaughter, even the last minute. Talk about the team's play without two
of the starters.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We talked after the game about this is a San Diego State
team victory, and it was personified tonight when arguably our best player, if
not right there, and tonight, for sure our best player, fouled out in Marcus.
And then Richie, who had been a dynamo out, we had guys that were able to hang
in there and deliver. It's nice to have veteran guys like Sharper and Trimaine
that can come in and fight. Then we've got some feisty young kids, Kyle and
Richie.  
So, I would have felt more comfortable had we had Marcus going into the
overtime. But we dug in there. You know, we should have, could have, but
didn't win it 30 minutes ago in regulation when Richie just did exactly what
he wanted to do, drove it to the rim. We were a little anxious and didn't
finish it.  
And then you got to make sure you're not too disappointed. We've had a
thought: Live in the moment and don't dwell on what just happened, make that
next play. And they did a nice job of that.  
Q. Your thoughts on Wyoming's performance tonight. Steve McClain thought it
was a phenomenal ballgame by two teams showing what the Mountain West
Conference is all about. Your thoughts on Wyoming?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: We have historically had some tremendous games with
Wyoming, at both places. We've won there; they've won in San Diego. We won a
game in Laramie that we shouldn't have early in the season. I think at times
one play can make a game, one game can make a season. I said that before the
game. I said, "I do believe for us, the play that Trimaine Davis made to tip
in the basket, get fouled, and the hopeless cause, for us to win that game
catapulted us to the rest of the story."  
I think it helped make this a great, great season for us. They played
terrific. They played absolutely -- they were like us. They had a hard time
scoring, but you couldn't tell the effort lagging at all on either end.  
Q. As you have some firsthand knowledge, this tournament over the last
couple years has had a history of Cinderella teams like Wyoming winning this
tournament. On this floor, they had a large contingent of their fans down here
for this game. How, with all that in mind, did you prepare this team mentally
coming into tonight's game?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I really don't think that we had to do anything along that
line. We do have a pretty mature club. Trimaine Davis is a fifth-year senior
captain. I've stated he's the best captain I've ever had, and I've had some
really, really good ones.  
He's not afraid to stand up and tell them what he thinks. If you come here to
play, you come here to win. I know that our guys were every bit as excited
about playing this game tonight as was an extremely excited, anxious and tough
Wyoming team.  
We were jabbing just as hard as they were.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach._  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Thank you.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Wyoming. Wyoming head
coach Steve McClain, Brad Jones, Brandon Ewing and Justin Williams._  
_Coach, if you'd open with some comments._  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: I think that might have been as good a college basketball
game as I've ever been involved in. You know, two teams that had a purpose,
they had something they wanted. Like I said, I don't know if I ever saw two
teams fight, grab, do whatever they had to do to try to win the game.  
And, again, it was unfortunate for us 'cause I think these kids laid it on the
line. I think more than anything they saw what Wyoming basketball is.  
You know, again, I give Steve Fisher and his staff credit. They did a great
job. You know, it's disappointing, but that's what happens this time of year.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions, please._  
Q. Coach, you had talked about believing for 40 minutes in the first two
ball games of the tournament. Did you just not plan for the extra five here
tonight?  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: Might have been. You know, and I think the thing is, you
know what, it was almost like that's how that game had to go. As hard as both
teams were fighting, it had to go another five minutes.  
You talk about guys step up and make plays, you know, the unfortunate thing
for us, they made the last play. But other than that, it was just that kind of
game.  
Q. Justin, obviously this has got to be a difficult way for you to end your
career here. What is running through your mind right now?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: Just how much I love my team, how hard we fought this
tournament.  
Q. Brandon and Justin, during the last couple of months, during the streak,
if you will, you thought you would be a dangerous team here in the tournament.
Are you pleased with the play? Disappointment? Obviously you came in here with
a purpose, that you thought you could do something, and you did.  
BRANDON EWING: Yeah, as competitive as we were, we're definitely disappointed
with the outcome. We're pleased with the way we played. We left it all out
there on the court. We played hard till the finish, all 45 minutes. I believe
we played as hard as we ever played.  
Just like coach said, the last couple of plays that they made, we missed a
couple of shots. But I take my hat off to them. They made the last plays to
win the game. But I'm definitely pleased the way we played throughout the
tournament.  
Q. Brad, Brandon Heath had what might be a bad game for him. He was 7 for
27. Overtime coming down the stretch, he hit a couple of baskets. Did he prove
that he was Player of the Year in that stretch?  
BRAD JONES: Yes, sir, I give Brandon Heath all the credit in the world. He's a
great player. I just wanted to try to stay in front of him, make him take
tough shots. He hit a couple of tough shots and he proved he was the best
player in the conference tonight.  
Q. With what's happened over the last few days with Coach McClain and his
uncertainty about his future, that didn't distract you. I'd like to hear your
thoughts on it, considering the two of you are returning, one of you is
considered the go-to player. And, coach, if you would comment on that, as
well. I know it's a touchy subject, but something your fans would like to hear
about.  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: I think, one, these kids understand what winning and
losing is. This wasn't about Steve McClain. This was about a group of kids
that invested. Am I proud of them? Yeah, I am, because they never let it be a
distraction. They understand one thing about Wyoming basketball: We're a
family, what happens stays in our family, and you don't let people outside you
try to tear you apart.  
I'll answer it for them. That's what they did. They didn't let anybody outside
try to tear apart what we were doing. You know what, sometimes in life some
people quit on you. This group of kids didn't worry about the people that had
quit; they worried about the 10,000 Wyoming fans that walked in there tonight
and gave everything they had to give, just like our team did. And I couldn't
be prouder of them for that.  
Q. Brad and Brandon, this run you guys made the last few days, how soon do
you have to start thinking about next year now? How promising have these last
few days been for the future of the team?  
BRAD JONES: Well, it's a tough loss. But I take my hat off to my seniors,
Justin and Derek. It's sad for them to go out like this. Me and Brandon
returning, there's a bright future and we think we could be in this same
situation next year if we work hard.  
Q. Talk about the way that Brandon played this weekend and his tournament
honors. If you would, kind of compare him to the point guard you had before,
Jay Straight, and the way he performed, especially in post-season?  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: One, I think he's reached the point, he don't have to be
compared to anybody. He's made his own legacy at this point. You know, I think
him and Brad have proven we could have one of the best back courts not only in
the Mountain West Conference next year but in the country.  
I give them credit because two young guys, two first-year guys were thrown a
lot of stuff. I never saw them fail. Some people say when you don't play
well... They understand one thing: If you watched them play, they leave it all
on the court, good or bad.  
I think Brandon had a great tournament. You know, I said when he didn't get
freshman of the year, you know, I kind of thought he was. You always feel like
your own player is. But his tournament play, I think, probably showed that.  
Q. Justin, the play inside was very physical tonight. It seems like it's
been physical with these guys all year. Did you feel like you and Derek and
Chris and Ike had a bit of an advantage, especially when you got Slaughter in
foul trouble?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: We didn't feel like we had an advantage when we got them in
foul trouble. We felt like we had an advantage from the start of the game.
Like coach says, you know, our main thing was to just go in and lay it all out
on the line and whatever happens happens. And that's what we went out and did.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys._  
Q. Coach, if you could talk about what Justin has meant to this program the
last two years, and how hard it's going to be to see him leave now.  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: Well, I think you look at his line tonight: 16 rebounds,
6 blocked shots. You know, he really grew as a player. One of the reasons NBA
people like him is because he just plays so hard. He doesn't always play
perfect, but he just plays hard.  
You know what, he always has a great enthusiasm for the game. He loves the
game. He wants to be a great player someday.  
My only regret is I didn't get to coach him for four years because the
progress he made in two was unbelievable.  
Q. Coach, last night Coach Giacoletti sat in this room and said this may be
one of the best coaching jobs you've ever done, particularly getting the kids
down the stretch. Aside everything that's swirling around right now, your
thoughts on this team and what it's going to mean to you when you wake up
tomorrow morning.  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: Well, unlike other people, I don't judge kids by wins and
losses. I judge how they represent the University of Wyoming. I couldn't be
prouder of 'em. You know, sometimes you walk in and you say, "Proud of a
team." "Proud" isn't the right word. This group of kids showed a lot of
character. They showed a lot of grit. You know what, in the end they have way
more character than a lot of people because they understood.  
I think, was it one of our best coaching jobs? I think our coaches did an
unbelievable job of staying focused on the task at hand. We stayed focused.
You know, I'm going to add to this. So many people in life don't ever get to
feel this feeling because they're scared to invest completely. This group of
kids wasn't scared to invest. They invested. And you know what, San Diego
State is feeling good, we're feeling like somebody tore our guts out. But you
know what, if you don't ever walk over that line and compete, then you don't
know what that feels like.  
So, yeah, I'm proud of 'em and wouldn't trade 'em for the world.  
Q. Can we expect a new wardrobe now? You indicated the wore the same suit,
shirt, everything for three nights here.  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: I don't know. It did well enough. You know, I might just
-- first game, you come to Laramie, I might wear it. I'm going to have to wear
it home tomorrow, though, because I didn't bring any other clothes (laughter).  
I'll tell you what, we're a little superstitious as coaches. But you know
what, there's nothing wrong with that. I'd have wore it another night if we
got one more opportunity to play.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach._

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with University of Wyoming. Joined by head coach
Steve McClain, Justin Williams, Brad Jones and Derek Wabbington._  
_Coach, let's begin with you. Just some general comments on the game._  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: Well, I thought, you know, once again the kids fought
through. I thought both teams at times looked a little tired.  
But we got a nice lead. We kept our lead. When they made their run, they never
got it back to a point where the pressure was on us. You know, they did a good
job, once again, of setting screens, moving the basketball. You know, we were
missing a few free-throws, then Justin kind of started us making 'em, then
Brad and Brandon kind of finished it off.  
You know, once again, a very good team effort out of everybody.  
_THE MODERATOR: Next few minutes, questions directed towards the student-
athletes._  
Q. Justin, did you know you needed those free-throws to get your triple?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: No. I never pay attention to things like that. Last game I
could have shot -- a couple games back, I could have did that. You know, I
just don't pay attention. I just play hard till the end of the buzzer.  
Q. When did you find out you had the triple?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I looked up on the Jumbotron while Brandon was shooting free-
throws and I seen it (smiling).  
Q. Justin, could you just talk about your game, especially blocked shots and
rebounding.  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I mean, that's just what I bring to the table. That's why
Coach McClain brought me here, was to rebound and blocks shots. I didn't go
out trying to score. I just wanted to do whatever it was I needed to do to
help my team get to the championship.  
Q. Brad, you spent a lot of time driving down the lane. Is that sort of part
of the game plan for you, to get to the basket like that?  
BRAD JONES: Yes, sir. Coach did a nice job of telling the bigs that if me and
Brandon get around the guards, just seal (indiscernible). They did a great job
of doing that. We had easy looks.  
Q. Brad, last week against Utah, you guys got off to a slow start. What did
you do tonight differently?  
BRAD JONES: Well, coach did a great job of getting us ready for the game plan,
showing us their sets, showing us what they're going to do on defense and
offense. We just knew we had to be the aggressor, to come out and play hard
from the jump and get the lead.  
Q. Brad, second half looked like they were spreading the middle for you.
What was going on there?  
BRAD JONES: Like I said, coach did a great job of telling the bigs that if we
got past their guards, just to hold the seal on the big man, so we could get
those easy layups and all. I owe it to these two guys. They seen me being my
man. They just held the seal. I got to the goal and finished the layup. Just
trying to do my job to help us win.  
Q. Justin and Derek, where are you guys drawing motivation? You're really
hitting your stride right now.  
DEREK WABBINGTON: Well, we're just getting it from each other. You know, our
coach always tells us when we're on the road, all we have is each other. We
just feed off of that.  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I think, you know, coach told us, you know, before the first
game, you know, we only have 40 minutes left. I think we really embraced that
as a team. Just went out and played for 40 minutes.  
Q. Derek, tell me about Nevill getting those early fouls, how important that
was. Was that kind of a goal?  
DEREK WABBINGTON: You know, our coach just told us to go out there and be
aggressive and be physical with him. That's what we tried to do. You know,
luckily he did pick up his early fouls and they had to go to their bench. We
just attacked from there.  
Q. What did it mean to have those fans tonight?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS: It meant a lot to us. It's a real great spirit going around
right now, Cowboy pride. You kind of felt it yesterday after the game, after
we went into the crowd and just said our hellos to our people.  
That's really lifting us up right there. This is almost like it's a home game
for us with all these fans we got out here. So, I mean, those Cowboy fans,
they're great fans. We've been saying it from the beginning. If they keep
coming out and supporting us, the sky's the limit.  
BRAD JONES: Like Justin said, it's a great atmosphere, just like we're playing
a home game. Coach always said, show them we're the hardest playing team for
them. We just try to play hard for them and get a victory.  
DEREK WABBINGTON: I just add to what they said. It's just big. We didn't have
the greatest year, and they're still coming out and supporting us. It just
really means a lot to everybody on the team.  
_THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks. Questions for Coach McClain._  
Q. First time it was overtime, and on the conference call this week you said
you kind of ran into a buzz saw. What do you expect tomorrow night? Going back
to the fan base, I don't know if it gives you an edge, but you can count on
the encouragement of those people.  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: And I think when you're playing three nights in a row,
maybe if we can get a little luck, that crowd can give us some energy, give us
something that will take it over the top.  
But, you know, the respect I have for what Steve Fisher has done this year.
There isn't any question about their talent level. There isn't any question
about the job he's done coaching that team.  
You know, I didn't think we were at our best tonight. We'll have to be at our
best. We'll have to do everything perfect to have an opportunity to win the
game.  
But, you know, when you get to this time of year, it's about getting to play
one more. Again, that's where I go back to San Diego State, people question
whether they should be in the NCAA tournament. They won the league outright
and now they're in the championship game. They shouldn't even have to worry
about being in the NCAA tournament.  
I think the fun part will be, it's going to be two teams that are going to lay
it on the line, and hopefully show people throughout the country what Mountain
West Conference basketball is.  
I think it all proves that, once again, when you start thinking about all the
players on San Diego State, Wyoming, Utah, Vegas, the number of young players
that are making these games happen, you know, how good is this league going to
be a year from now?  
But, you know, hopefully our fans are going to help us out a little bit
tomorrow night.  
Q. Did you see something before the game in Justin's eyes, anything Utah was
doing that foretold you he was going to have a monster game on the defensive
end?  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: I think, one, we changed it up a little bit and we didn't
have him guard Nevill the whole time. We had Wab guard him. We had Chris
Anderson guard him. But then Justin could go guard him. He's such a different
defender, it created, you know, blocked shots, it created other things.  
You know, again, these kids have taken their hits, yet the last game of the
year they were playing as hard as they could. I think, you know, this senior
group wants to still be remembered for something. They're playing. I don't see
a bunch of guys that are tired and ready for it to be over.  
An old coach told me a long time ago, he said, "Steve, come this time of year,
teams that want it to be over, it's usually over." And I don't think this
group wants it to be over.  
Q. You're aware that in the past in this tournament, San Diego State won it
all I think as a five, Colorado State as a 6. Do you think as a 7 it is kind
of your destiny this year?  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: I don't know. You know, if Steve and them want to let it
be, I'd sure like it. You know, it's one thing about our league, the champion
of the league has had a hard time ever winning the conference tournament.  
I just think, more than anything, it says something about the depth in our
conference. You know, I read where somebody wrote that, you know, they thought
this was a mediocre league. I don't think you can be the eighth ranked
conference in the country and be a called a mediocre league.  
If we were 18th or 19th, maybe you'd call us a mediocre league. But we're
right there with the Big-12, the Big-10. I just think it says something about
the depth and the coaches in this league, the respect they have for each
other, the programs, and what they're doing.  
Q. You have said all year that you're right there, on the verge of being a
top team in this league. Do you feel like you have maybe gotten past that now
and are at the point where you are just there?  
COACH STEVE McCLAIN: You know, I think the kids are playing with a lot of
confidence. This group of kids hasn't had a lot good happen for 'em. You know,
they've had people take shots at 'em.  
I think Wab said it best. I teach kids in life, "Control what you can control;
don't worry about what anybody else is saying; don't worry about what they're
doing; you control what you can control." And they've believed that. They've
kept getting better. So, you know, again, we're playing for a championship. No
matter what anybody wants to say about our program, this will be three out of
eight years that my program has played for a championship. We've won two
championships outright, and we'll play for the third one this year, with some
pretty young players.  
I think, you know, to answer your question even simpler, they believe in what
we're doing. They're going to try to lay it out there for 40 more minutes.
They're laying it out there for 40 more minutes.  
I went back and used a Billy Tubbs. When I left the other day, I brought one
suit. If you notice, I'm wearing the same clothes I wore last night. I'm going
to wear 'em again tomorrow night. Because about eight years ago, we went to
Vegas, and Billy said before we left, "One suit." I said, "What do you mean
one suit?" He said, "One suit. Any time you pack for more days, you don't get
to stay. Let's pack for one day and maybe we'll stay."  
Well, we stayed four nights. I packed for one day. We're going to play another
night. Again, I couldn't be prouder of these kids.

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Brandon Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16306)

### [Marcus Slaughter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14515)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and begin first with San Diego State. Joining
me on stage, head Coach Steve Fisher, Brandon Heath, Marcus Slaughter._  
_Coach, if you want to begin with some general comments._  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I'm extremely proud of how we competed and fought,
especially down the stretch and especially with how we guarded and rebounded
the ball. If there's a better rebounder in the country than Marcus, I haven't
seen him, and I hope we play him. He got some balls that he had no right to
get because of his just "I'm going to get the ball."  
And I don't think you can look at Brandon's numbers; you got to look at when
he makes important baskets. And he did that for us down the stretch tonight.
And at the end - I'm going to talk out of school - I was going to take Brandon
out with six seconds to go because I thought he was so tired. And he grabbed
me and he said, Please don't. So I didn't. That was with about 20 second to
go, not 6 seconds to go.  
So it was a great win for San Diego State. These are hard losses. I told Lon,
I said it's hard, I know it's hard. But I'm extremely proud of how we fought
and competed and found a way to win against a team that did exactly the same.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Next few minutes let's direct questions to the
student athletes._  
Q. Brandon, can you talk about what you saw as that ball bounced to you on
the three that you made that put your team ahead?  
BRANDON HEATH: Our team did a great job of going after 50/50 balls. And once
we got control of the ball, our team was very unselfish. John Sharper had to
look at basket, but instead he passed up that shot, make the extra pass
because I had a better look. That was basically what it was, winning a 50/50
game down the stretch and being unselfish as a team.  
Q. Marcus, are you fatigued after that many rebounds in two games? Now is it
all will and wanting to keep winning and not refusing to lose and not get
balls?  
MARCUS SLAUGHTER: No, I never get tired. We're trying to win a championship
right now. And coach said to win a championship, it takes defensive
rebounding, and we showed that today, and we're going to continue to show it
throughout this tournament. I'm not tired. I still want more.  
Q. Marcus, can you talk a little bit about the effort of UNLV coming back in
the second half like that playing the way they did. You guys handled them well
in the regular season.  
MARCUS SLAUGHTER: We knew it was going to be a battle going against UNLV. From
last year, them coming back at our house, beating us. This year, it was a
tough game playing against UNLV, knowing they run up and down. They had a
great fight out there. They didn't give up. We knew they wouldn't give up. At
the end we made some plays we needed to make and got the victory.  
_THE MODERATOR: Fellows, we'll let you two go. Thanks very much._  
Q. Coach, can you comment further on the offensive contribution of these
two?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: I'm sorry. I'm going deaf, I think.  
Q. Can you comment further on their performance.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Brandon has been a guy that demands the ball when winning
is on the line, and he's made a ton of big-time baskets. Marcus is someone
that, he gets to the free-throw line, double figures every game. So our
thought was if we could throw it to him and he had a little patience, we can
get him to the free-throw line. And those were the two guys we wanted to play
through - not that they had to shoot it, but they had to touch it.  
Q. Steve, you fouled. It worked out probably as you imagined or hoped it
would.  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Well, I didn't tell them this, but I had thoughts of a
year ago when we had a three-point lead with six seconds to go. I told him
exactly what I thought they were going to do and try to get it on the run. And
we said, We have to foul them, we have to foul them. I'd like to foul them
just as they're crossing mid-court to burn two or three seconds, but you have
to foul them.  
And Brandon three times said, Do you understand the game plan? We've practiced
this some, but to do it in practice and carrying it out in a game sometimes it
can -- you can lose the thought. But we did a good job. And Matt did a nice
job not fouling him immediately so we were able to eat up two or three
seconds.  
Q. Can you talk about the significance of Amundson fouling out with 2:48 to
go?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: It was obviously a huge piece to the puzzle when Amundson
got his second foul and sat 8 or 9 minutes in the first half, and then went on
the bench. He's a hard guard. He's a tough guy in the post and they play
through him. He can get to the free-throw line.  
I thought we did a really good job with our post double. But in your post
double there's a potential for a quick swing and an open-three point look, so
we were able to not have quite as many of those situations when he, A, got in
foul trouble in the first half, and then, B, fouled out.  
Q. Coach, obviously we got a game to play, but can you talk about the Utes,
and when you played them the second time, what did they do to be so successful
against you?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Be real honest, and no disrespect to the Utes. I'm not
thinking about them at all right now. We're going to go out and scout two
teams. They beat us at our place and played very well doing it. I didn't see
in person, but I watched the game last night, and they earned that victory
over BYU.  
And whoever we play, we will have every bit the battle that we had tonight.  
Q. Coach, your team's best path to the tournament is to win tomorrow, but
what do you look at as far as some of the other teams in the conference as far
as NCAA berths?  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Obviously the winner of the game tomorrow tonight gets the
automatic bid, and it will be us and either Utah or Wyoming. Air Force has a
resume that has to merit entry, and so does BYU. So those are the other two
teams that right now could make a strong case. And hopefully there will be
people that argue the case for whomever, that there should be multiple entries
into the tournament from the Mountain West Conference.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach._  
COACH STEVE FISHER: Thank you.

### [Luke Neville](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16410)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Utah. Head coach Ray Giacoletti, Luke Nevill,
Bryant Markson, and Tim Drisdom._  
_Coach, if you want to just open with some general remarks on the game._  
COACH RAY GIACOLETTI: You know, I just kind of right off the top, Wyoming was
the aggressor tonight with their triple penetration offensively, really kind
of put us back on our heels.  
The other piece of the puzzle, as I look at the stat sheet, I can't remember a
center going out and getting a triple double, 12 blocks and how much of an
impact he had. The guy scores 10 points but goes and gets 15 rebounds and 12
blocks. You don't see that very much. You don't see an athletic guy like that
that's able to block shots and stay out of foul trouble like he was. To me, he
changed the game tonight.  
But I'm proud of our effort. Just had a stretch there right at the end of that
second half where we kind of got it back and was not able to -- I think we --
I don't know if we got it to four or five, but to Wyoming's credit, they did a
great job of defending, guarding, putting us on our heels defensively.  
_THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tim, Bryant or Luke._  
Q. Luke, you just saw Justin Williams last week. Did he do anything
different tonight? How did he upset you inside so much?  
LUKE NEVILL: He did a tremendous effort of just, you know, coming over to help
any penetration basically. All our guards and forwards, just penetrating, even
me, you just changed. Everybody shot. Even if he didn't block it, we had to
shoot it a bit higher, shoot it a bit quicker. He just upset us offensively.  
Q. Luke, did it matter that he played off you for a little bit tonight? Did
he bother you more as a help guy or when he was straight up on you?  
LUKE NEVILL: It's hard to tell. I mean, whenever I went to take a shot, he
just seemed like he was around me no matter where, if he was playing on me or
if he was playing on someone else. He would just always come over to help.  
So, I mean, I prefer to play on him basically because, you know, I could use
my body a bit more. But, you know, it didn't really matter in the outcome.  
Q. Bryant, can you address that, too, what Williams did your shots on the
inside?  
BRYANT MARKSON: It just felt like when I was going up, he was always there.
One time I thought I had an open layup, he just came and blocked it.  
He was just aggressive tonight, just being well-alert, shows why he's a good
defensive player. I think he adjusted a lot of people's shots down there
tonight. We just thought about it every time we drove, and that had a big
impact on the game.  
Q. Can the seniors reflect back on the time you've had at Utah, the highs
and the lows.  
TIM DRISDOM: This has obviously been the most challenging year in our career.
You know, like I tell a lot of other people, for me personally, I mean, did I
have the senior year I could have had? Probably not. But I think what I'll
take from this is, we have a lot of young guys, and a lot of guys with
potential. I was able to help them along the way. This was a tough season.
It's tough for them to experience this in their first year.  
I think for me, my role this year was just to try to help those guys along,
try to tell them everything I know, you know, everything I've experienced. And
I think that I've been a part of, with Bryant and also Chris, starting
something new, starting a new tradition with the Utah program.  
You know, I think there are better years to come. Like I said, I mean, we've
had great times, you know, being in the Sweet-16, the whole nine. This was
just a year that I think the young guys needed us more, needed me more for
sure, just as a vocal leader and as a teacher, as a guy with the experience,
as a guy who's their peer, who they feel like they can trust.  
I'm real proud of the career I've had. I'm real proud of B's career. He's had
a tough two years. You know, these last two years, he's been our guy,
especially this year. Red, the same way. He's kind of been the second guy, but
always a vocal leader. So, like I said, I think the team has a lot of
potential and I think we're going to be just fine in the future.  
BRYANT MARKSON: Four years here have been great for me. The first two have
been tough. I had a tough coach and I learned a lot from that situation. When
Coach Giac came, he told me he believed in me, and Rich got hurt, and I made
the most of my opportunity. Ever since then, I've just been working on my game
hard. Coach has just been talking to me and instilling to play defense and
rebound.  
Most people say my senior year was kind of inconsistent. But to me it really
wasn't. I mean, it depends on what the game plan is. I don't care about going
out to score every night or doing anything like that. As long as I'm playing
defense and getting everybody else better, it's fine.  
It's been good. I mean, this year has been a tough one. But you learn a lot
from it. The young guys learned a lot from us. They're going to rebuild.  
Q. Bryant, you went through the whole season having periodic scoring
droughts. How do you explain those?  
BRYANT MARKSON: I don't know. I think it's just from -- we get good shots.
Sometimes our shots don't go down. We get open looks sometimes. They just
don't fall down. Scoring drought happens. Every team goes through it.  
THE MODERATOR: Nice job, fellas. You three can go.  
Questions for coach.  
Q. With the emotional win last night, do you feel like your players maybe
had some tired legs tonight?  
COACH RAY GIACOLETTI: Wyoming went through the same thing, so it's even. I do
think that Wyoming was a little bit more energized than we were. We talked
about it all day today, about trying to have that gladiator mentality. It was
more mental than physical.  
But I'll take my hat off to Wyoming and the job they did and Steve. I mean, he
got those kids to play their butts off two nights in a row. I know he's been
under a lot of criticism this year. I think he's done an amazing job. People
have no idea what it is to try to rally a team in March, for those kids to
have gone through tough times, still believe in him and in that program in
that situation. You know, somebody needs to stand up and recognize that.  
Q. You had a season that was pretty unusual. How do you look at the season
as a whole?  
COACH RAY GIACOLETTI: I mean, we started three freshmen and a sophomore for a
lot of it. I mean, you're going to go through some growing pains. We're
missing a couple classes. It's not excuses. I think we got a pretty good
center. If there's a better freshman center on the West Coast, I'd like to see
him.  
I think we're going to be fine. We had our ups and downs, which I think you go
through with young guys. You know, I'm more of just dealing with black and
white. When we have tough times, I address them and try to get through them
the best we can, not make excuses. This non-conference part of our season, we
didn't, I thought, give maximum effort. I would call it like I see it.  
But I think this team has grown up a lot. I think we had a real fine line to
really where we could have finished strong. We had the BYU win, then at San
Diego State, came back home and got beat on last-second threes with Colorado
State and with Air Force, which I think really knocked us back down.  
We're very fragile mentally. I think it probably comes with young guys. I
think if we get through that week, but that's the way sports are. If it could
have, would have, should have. If you could have got through that week, you
think you could really have gained some momentum. We didn't. But they
continued to fight.  
It's kind of where we're at. Help's on the way. Big Serb will get a year back
and have two years left. Our recruiting class is already done with signing
five kids early. I couldn't be more excited there. I sleep good at night
knowing the future. I think I'm realistic with things. If it wasn't, I'd be a
little bit nervous right now. But I think we're where we were expected to be.
I would have hoped we could have won a few more games this year.  
Q. You were pretty animated the last few minutes, moving guards in and out
of the game. What were you looking for from those guys?  
COACH RAY GIACOLETTI: We were going to try to press of made free-throws or
made field goals and call timeout. We were just trying to, with the
substitution in a free-throw situation, they'll stop for the sub so we could
get lined up in our pressure. We were going to try to face guard guys and see
if we could create a turnover.  
Q. What was going on with Lawrence and Luke at the end?  
COACH RAY GIACOLETTI: They kind of had some words. I've probably brought that
along because I've said all along that we need to hold each other accountable.
Emotions run high. Those are two good kids. I actually don't have a problem
with that. We don't need to do it out on the floor.  
We've been pushing hard to try to get some more emotion and holding each other
accountable for things. I think no big deal.  
Q. A moment ago you said something about Steve's coaching this year, that
somebody ought to say something about it. Could you elaborate?  
COACH RAY GIACOLETTI: Yeah. I have a tough time when people kick a guy when
he's down. I have a real tough time with that. That's the way it's become in
society today. Shoot, it's easy to kick a guy when he's down. Who's going to
have some backbone to back him when it's gotten a little tough? He's done a
hell of a job up there.  
It's okay today. I mean, you turn on any radio show, you turn on any TV show,
and it's okay, especially with sports. It's enough. I mean, it's a human being
with a family. Treat him that way. I think he's a pretty good guy. I think
he's treated people in a pretty good fashion.  
But our society today, you turn the TV on every day and you've got, you know,
Jim Boeheim, who has won a national championship, who snaps. But he's been
pushed so far that, yeah, you're going to get a reaction.  
I just think this thing's gotten way out of whack. It's acceptable to write or
say or do whatever you want. Who is going to be tough enough to stand up and
back the guy? I'm sure there's going to be a lot of bandwagon jumpers now.  
I've been doing this 21 years. This is my ninth as a head coach. It ain't
easy. Everybody's got the answer. People that stick together with things and
fight through things, are going to be successful. In our business right now,
you turn the TV on every day, it's easy just to talk bad about somebody or try
to fire somebody. I think we as coaches need to band together and help each
other out. I think you're seeing a little bit more of that. Olden days, I say
"olden," but when I was in high school, our coaches would go out for pizza and
beer afterwards. Today you wouldn't be seen with somebody because you're
trying to one-up somebody else or cut somebody else's throat with recruiting.  
Gosh. Enough. I got a little band of best friends, four or five in this
business, the only people I trust. We all need to help each other out through
this. Yeah, it's competitive, but I think it's just gone too far.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thank you._

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2006&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2006

  

### [Jo'van Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16412)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Wendell White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16411)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
_THE MODERATOR: Now joined by UNLV head coach Lon Kruger, Wendell White and
Jo'Van Adams. Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks._  
COACH LON KRUGER: It's really disappointing for our guys and very proud of
their effort and ability to hang in there and hang together. And again, you
know, a battle with a very good San Diego State club right to the wire. And
congratulations to Steve and his group. They're very deserving championships
in the regular season, and I'm sure it will be a good game tomorrow tonight.  
I'm really proud of our guys' effort and disappointed for them and the result,
but I feel great about what they did.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions directed now to the student-
athletes._  
Q. Can you talk about the effort tonight to come back in the second half?  
JO'VAN ADAMS: I think tonight our team came out in the second half with a lot
of fight, a lot of aggressiveness. San Diego State is a good team. I mean,
down the stretch they just kind of got the best of us on the boards, and they
really hurt us down the stretch.  
Q. Wendell, can you talk about the idea of struggling on the boards late in
the game? They had a couple of second-chance opportunities that they were able
to convert. Cost you guys a couple of points down the line.  
WENDELL WHITE: Other than that, I feel like we did a good job on the boards.
But it was came out their way. I mean I can't really say.  
_THE MODERATOR: Guys, that was quick and easy. Thanks very much. You guys can
take off._  
_Questions now for Coach Kruger._  
Q. How did Louis' foul trouble affect you guys tonight?  
COACH LON KRUGER: Well, obviously Louis a guy that's been kind of the
cornerstone for what we've done all year. He turned his ankle last Wednesday
and he's been battling back from that. I think that is as probably frustrating
to Louis as anything because his inability to do maybe what he had been doing
during the year. He gave it a go and he tried. And we really appreciate his
effort in getting out there and making a go of it.  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the situation with Curtis on the traveling call
there. A game of human frailty sometimes?  
COACH LON KRUGER: There's a little gap there for Louis to try to sneak into,
and he didn't quite get it done. Whether or not for whatever reason, it was a
case there where we got an opportunity to go back in the lead and, like you
say, close, but didn't happen for him.  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about Brandon Heath's play down the
stretch and how he kind of lifted their team.  
COACH LON KRUGER: I thought Brandon made huge plays down the stretch, two or
three really big buckets that for most people thought shots. Brandon makes
those. Our guys were battling defensively and made him shoot relatively
difficult shoots. Brandon is a great player, conference player of the year and
very deserving. Stepped up there when they needed big buckets and converted.  
_THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach._
